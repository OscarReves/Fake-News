This is not the first time that ABC News has pulled an investigation into Scientology from airing on 20/20. \nA press release published by ABC on Thursday announced the scheduled airing of the investigation. It described the program as \"an in-depth look\" by Elizabeth Vargas into the recent report on Tom Cruise and Scientology by journalist Maureen Orth for Vanity Fair in its October 2012 publication.\nAn analysis of the situation by Editor-in-Chief Tony Ortega of The Village Voice pointed out that in 2008, actor and former Scientologist Jason Beghe was interviewed by Elizabeth Vargas after he had flown to New York. Beghe recounted to Vargas his experiences within Scientology and his decision to cease activity in the organization. \nHowever, this interview by Vargas was never shown on ABC. \n\u2014Editor-in-Chief Tony Ortega, The Village VoiceOrtega noted, \"Then, Friday night, ABC caved again, and this time much more publicly.\" He highlighted a television screenshot which displays clearly the description given by ABC for the 20/20 program scheduled for Friday: \"20/20. New. 'Lovestyles of the Rich and Famous; The Camera Never Lies' Journalist Maureen Orth discusses her recent article in Vanity Fair on Scientology and actor Tom Cruise; celebrity\".\nAccording to Ortega, this was to be a significant investigation into Scientology. It was going to cover topics including the recent divorce of actress Katie Holmes from Tom Cruise, the role of minors within the Scientology organization, material on Scientology's chief David Miscavige, and controversy regarding the elite Scientology group known as the Sea Org. Ortega was himself interviewed as part of the investigation, which he was told would comprise an hour-long broadcast. \n\u2014Marc HeadleyIn addition to Ortega, former Scientologists Marc Headley and his wife Claire were interviewed by ABC News for the 20/20 piece which they were informed would be complemented by a news segment on Nightline. Claire told the camera of her two mandatory abortions she experienced while a member of the Sea Org in Scientology; Ortega reported that this interview moved the ABC television crew to tears.\nMarc Headley confirmed that he had learned of the ABC News decision. In a post Friday to a legal fund webpage he set up to support his family with litigation costs from Scientology, he commented: \"We just got word that both ABC 20/20 & Nightline have pulled the TV shows that were going to air tonight. It appears that someone at OSA is trying to sandbag the downstats over the next few weeks.\" OSA is an abbreviation for the Office of Special Affairs \u2014 a department within Scientology which has been compared to an intelligence agency that handles legal affairs and public relations. Downstat refers to a negative impact on statistics gathered by Scientology members of the Sea Org due to critical investigations of the organization by the media.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

In Massachusetts and Michigan, voters passed measures that loosen marijuana laws. Finally, in the state of Washington a measure was passed that allows physician-assisted suicide.\nThe California ballot measure, Proposition 8, overturns the recent June ruling by the California State Supreme Court in the case In re Marriage Cases which reversed a 1977 statute passed by the California State Legislature and a 2000 ballot measure, Proposition 22, which also banned same-sex marriage by defining marriage as between a man and a woman. The wording of Proposition 8 is identical to Proposition 22. It was noted that many of the African-Americans and Latinos who cast their votes for Obama, also voted for the measure. The measure passed at 52% to 48%.\nLesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres noted, \"This morning, when it was clear that Proposition 8 had passed in California, I can\u2019t explain the feeling I had. I was saddened beyond belief. Here we just had a giant step toward equality and then on the very next day, we took a giant step away.\"\n\u2014Melissa EtheridgeSinger Melissa Etheridge, who is also a lesbian, stated that she would no longer pay taxes due to the passing of Proposition 8, announcing in a blog post, \"Okay, so I am taking that to mean I do not have to pay my state taxes because I am not a full citizen.\"\nAlso in California, voters rejected a measure which would require parental notification for a minor to receive an abortion. The measure was rejected with the same percentage as Proposition 8, 52% to 48%. Meanwhile in Colorado, voters rejected a measure that would define life as beginning at conception. While the measure did not specifically mention abortion it would have required legislators and courts to confront legal rights for fetuses - effectively preventing abortion. The measure was defeated in a wide margin, 73% to 27%\nIn South Dakota, voters also defeated an anti-abortion measure which would have outlawed abortion in all cases except in the case of rape, incest or if the mother's health was in serious question. If passed, the law would most likely have been challenged as unconstitutional.\nIn Michigan, voters approved a measure which legalizes medical marijuana. Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, voters approved a ballot question that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana in which the possession of an ounce or less would be punishable by a $100 fine. The measure will also require minors under the age 18 to participate in and complete a drug awareness program and do community service. Failure to do so, would net the minor a $1,000 fine.\n\"Tonight's results represent a sea change. Voters have spectacularly rejected eight years of the most intense government war on marijuana since the days of 'Reefer Madness,'\" said Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project. \"The people were ahead of the politicians on this issue; they recognize and want a more sensible approach to our marijuana policy,\" said Whitney Taylor, the chair of Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy, which backed the Massachusetts proposition.\nAlso, in Massachusetts, voters overwhelmingly, in every single Massachusetts city and town, rejected a ballot measure which would have eliminated the state income tax by 2010, the ballot measure was sponsored by the Committee for Small Government, which is headed up by two libertarians, Michael Cloud, a Libertarian Party candidate for U.S. Senate in 2002 and Carla Howell, Libertarian Party candidate for governor in the 2002 Massachusetts gubernatorial election. \nThe last time the income tax elimination measure was on the ballot was in 2002, where it was defeated, narrowly by 45.3%. This stunned supporters of the income tax, who mounted a fierce campaign against the measure this time warning Massachusetts residents that repealing the income tax would have drastic effects on the state's finances, leading to cuts in services, education and local aid.\nFinally, voters passed a question which bans dog racing in Massachusetts, which will lead to the closure of Massachusetts' two greyhound racing tracks, Raynham-Taunton Greyhound Park and Wonderland Greyhound Park. \nThe campaign against dog racing was headed up by the Committee to Protect Dogs and endorsed by GREY2K USA and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals along with other animal protection organizations who claimed that dog racing was inhumane as the dogs were stuffed into cramped cages and endured injuries. The measure was opposed by the park owners including George Carney who owns the Rayham-Taunton park and Charles Sarkis, a restaurateur who owns Wonderland.\n\"We did it. We did it for the dogs,\" said Carey Thiel, executive director of GREY2K USA. \"For 75 years, greyhounds in our state have endured terrible confinement and suffered serious injuries. We're better than that,\" Thiel added.\nOne campaign supporter,  Sandy Bigelow noted, \"It means everything. We've worked so hard for the dogs and they heard us. It feels so good. Oh, God, it feels so good.\"\nGeorge Carney said of the results, \"It's not a very pleasant thing right now. Some of these people have been here 40 years. Here's a company that did nothing wrong, paid their federal taxes on time, paid the town on time. The town is going to be a severe loser, and a lot of people here dedicated their life to the company.\"\n\u2014Carey Thiel, GREY2KUSABoth sides used emotionally-charged advertisements, the anti-racing side showing \u201csad-eyed greyhounds,\u201d while the pro-racing side highlighted the workers who would be out of work when the tracks close.\nBoth measures must now come before the Massachusetts Governor's Council for approval. \nA ballot initiative approved by voters in the north-western state of Washington will make it the second state to permit physician-assisted suicide.   \nInitiative 1000 follows the ten-year-old example of the Death With Dignity Act of neighboring Oregon, and will allow physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication for a terminally ill patient to administer themselves.  \nIt was approved by a margin of 16%, and the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign outspent the \u2018No\u2019 campaign by more than three-to-one.  The law comes into effect in 2009.\n\nHave an opinion on this story? Share it!\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

Later on the same program, he said, \"With all the provocations from Se\u00f1ora Valenciano, all the demagoguery and populist statements, with all the half truths and lies, if I had been myself I would fear me.  I would have gone for the kill\" ((es))Spanish language: \u200dCon todas las provocaciones de la se\u00f1ora Valenciano, toda la demagogia y apelaciones al populismo, con todas las medias verdades y mentiras, si soy yo mismo me temo.

Remove women from debate??\" ((es))Spanish language: \u200dEntonces?? Qu\u00e9 hacemos? Fuera mujeres del debate??\nThe quote was read live to Ca\u00f1ete, who responded by saying, \"For me, it is more difficult, it is harder.\" ((es))Spanish language: \u200dPara m\u00ed es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, me cuesta m\u00e1s.

Neither politician talked much about corruption, Catalonia or Europe.  The topic of abortion was brought up and discussed by Valenciano, but before Ca\u00f1ete had the chance to respond to her remarks, the debate televiser RTVE cut to commercial.  Partido Popular had supported changes in abortion law that were viewed as controversial, and led to protests by several thousand people claiming the changes encroached on the rights of women.  In the debate, Valenciano said Partido Popular had suspended their efforts to change the law in order to win this election.\nThe European Parliament elections are scheduled to be held on May 25.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

She will re-join her father Frank Stronach's company Magna International Inc., a large auto parts company, as the executive vice-chairwoman.\n\"My father is looking to the future, the company is facing important strategic decisions, and the Canadian and global auto sector and economy are in a period of great challenge,\" Stronach announced. \"So I am stepping aside from elected politics for the time being and will now take part in public life in a different way...I will continue to represent the interests of the constituents I serve until such time as a federal election is called,\" she said. \"I also plan to continue to play an active role in the community.\"\nDuring Stronach's career a series of events have made national headlines.\nIn 2004, she ran against now Prime Minister Stephen Harper for leadership of then the new formed Conservative Party of Canada and finished second on the first ballot. She was later elected as Conservative MP for Newmarket\u2014Aurora. Stronach had many differences to Stephen Harper and his Conservatives supporting abortion and same-sex marriages. She also claimed the party was going too far-right. In 2005, two days before a non-confidence vote to bring down the Liberal government, she crossed the floor to the Liberal Party of Canada and retained her seat. Upon her crossing she immediately became Minister of Human Resources and Social Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal. It also ended her personal relationship with fellow Conservative MP Peter MacKay. If Stronach had not joined the Liberals an election would have been called. On April 6, 2006, Stronach held a news conference announcing that she would not seek the leadership of the Liberals, which was later won by Stephane Dion.\nIn September, she was caught cheating with former NHL player Tie Domi. In October 2006, Peter MacKay referred to Stranach as a \"dog\". Stronach, a feminist, demanded an immediate apology and said that it offended all Canadian women.\nCTV bureau chief Robert Fife speculated the decision by Stronach, not to seek re-election, may have had something to do with her dissatisfaction over a diminished role in the new Dion caucus. \"She did not have a high-profile critic's role and she had not been prominent in asking questions in question period after Mr. Dion took over,\" suggested Fife.\nStronach has been serving as Critic for Competitiveness and New Economy. She previously served as Critic for the Minister of Transport under interim leader Bill Graham.\nThe public is also questioning Stronach's move to keep her seat until the next federal election, they happen every five years or less. If she had decided to leave her seat completely, an immediate by-election would be called.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

Introduced in 1983, the eighth amendment made abortion constitutionally illegal. Irish Taoiseach \u2014 Prime Minister \u2014 Leo Varadkar said supporting legislation, to be framed following the result of this referendum, is to be \"enacted before the end of this year\".\nMore than 2.1 million people voted on the referendum on Friday. With a 64.1% turnout, 1,429,981 voted in favour of eliminating the abortion ban while 723,632 voted to keep it. The results were announced at Dublin Castle. About 6000 voters spoiled their votes. Calling it \"an historic day\", Prime Minister Varadkar said it was \"a great act of democracy.\" Ministers said they would form laws allowing medical termination of pregnancy in the first trimester, twelve weeks, of pregnancy, and under special cases until the 24th week. The legislation is to be formed after discussion with medical experts.\nSince the amendment, Article 40.3.3 of the Irish constitution, in 1983, which gave an unborn child equal rights to life as the mother, hundreds of thousands of women traveled to different countries for the medical termination of pregnancy, while some used medical drugs illegal in Ireland to terminate the pregnancy.\n\"Savita Matters, Women Matter\" was one of the slogans used by the supporters who wanted to repeal the amendment. In October 2012, a 31-year-old dentist of Indian origin, Savita Halappanavar, died from sepsis at a Galway hospital after she was denied abortion for a protracted miscarriage. She was told by a midwife that termination of pregnancy would not be possible since Ireland was a \"Catholic country\". Halappanavar's photo was used for posters by supporters who wanted the 35-year-old amendment repealed. In 2016, the current Roman Catholic Pope, Pope Francis, described abortion as a \"very grave sin\" and a \"horrendous crime\".\nHalappanavar's father Andanappa Yalagi told Hindustan Times, \"We've got justice for Savita. What happened to her will not happen to any other family. I have no words to express my gratitude to the people of Ireland at this historic moment.\" 39 of 40 Irish constituencies voted in favour of repealing the law, while voters in only one constituency, Donegal, voted against \u2014 51.87% opting to keep the anti-abortion laws. After the result was announced, the crowd were chanting Savita's name in front of Dublin Castle.\nCora Sherlock, an anti-abortion activist, said, \"what we voted on today is the ending of human life.\" \"I will accept the will of the Irish people, at the same time I will make it very clear what I feel of the campaign that has taken place. We will now regroup and find out what our next move is\", she added. Another activist, David Quinn, said, \"The result today is basically a reversal of the 1983 result. On that occasion the defeated side did not simply slip away.\"\n\"The people have said that we want a modern constitution for a modern country\", Prime Minister Varadkar said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later congratulated Varadkar on Twitter, saying: \"What a moment for democracy and women's rights.\" \n\nHave an opinion on this story?

This battle will be won in the hearts and souls of the American people.\" While in another questionnaire for his 1994 Senate campaign in Tennessee, \"Mr. Thompson or his campaign staff checked a box stating that he believed abortion should be legal under any circumstance during the first three months of a pregnancy.\" Meanwhile in a televised debate the same year, Mr. Thompson told the moderator that he disagreed with outlawing abortion: \"Should the government come in and criminalize let\u2019s say a young girl and her parents and her doctor?\" Mr. Thompson said. \"I think not.\"\nAccording to the LA Times, while Thompson \"sided with antiabortion advocates on most key issues\" as Senator (1994 to January 2003) and publicly criticizes the Roe v Wade decision, the article noted \"Some conservatives said the [abortion] lobbying claims added to anxieties\" about Thomspon.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

Senate Democrats have reached a breakthrough in their struggle to pass sweeping heath care reform legislation, lining up the 60 votes needed to overcome fierce Republican opposition. Senators met Saturday in Washington, D.C. during a driving snowstorm in a frenzied effort to move forward on President Barack Obama's top domestic priority.\nThe spotlight was on moderate Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who had been the last holdout as Senate Democrats raced against the clock and against determined Republican opposition to pass their health care bill by their self-imposed deadline of December 25th, Christmas.\n\u2014Ben Nelson, Democratic Senator for NebraskaNelson said he is now ready to vote for cloture, which would advance the bill. \"Change is never easy, but change is what is necessary in America today and and that is why I intend to vote for cloture, I intend to vote for cloture and for health care reform,\" he said.\nNelson said he decided to support the bill after winning new concessions from Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to limit the availability of abortions in insurance sold under the new legislation along with millions of dollars in Medicaid funding for Nebraska.\nThe legislation would extend health benefits to more than 30 million uninsured Americans and impose new regulations on the health insurance industry. \nSenator Reid of Nevada has been working for months to win over one holdout Democratic senator after another, repeatedly altering the bill to satisfy different demands. Reid says reform is essential. \"The broken system cannot continue and it will not continue. When President Obama signs this bill into law, we will officially end the era in which insurance companies win only when patients lose,\" he said.\n\u2014Harry Reid, Democratic Senate Majority LeaderNelson's support should pave the way for Senate Democrats to win the first of a series of crucial procedural votes scheduled to begin at one o'clock in the morning on Monday and set to conclude \u2014 if everything goes smoothly for them \u2014 with final passage on Christmas Eve.\nRepublicans have been using a number of parliamentary procedures to delay action on the bill, including forcing a reading on the Senate floor Saturday of Reid's 338-pages of last minute amendments. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky responded to the apparent Democratic breakthrough. \"And Democrats are forcing a vote on it, as I indicated, over the weekend, counting on the fact that the American people are preoccupied with Christmas and not paying much attention to what they are doing,\" he said.\n\u2014Mitch McConnell, Republican Senate Minority LeaderRepublicans are unified in their opposition, saying the bill is too expensive and will not solve the problems with the current health care system. Senator McConnell dismissed claims by Democrats that the bill is historic. \"The history that is being made here, make no mistake about it, the history that is being made here, is the ignoring of the will of the American people,\" he said.\nSenator John McCain of Arizona echoed those comments in the weekly Republican radio address saying, \"Regrettably, there\u2019s nothing in this legislation that effectively addresses the problem of health care hyperinflation. In fact, experts tell us the Democrat legislation makes matters worse.\"\nDemocrats say they have been trying to reform the nation's health care system for close to 70 years, ever since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in office. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut was emotional as victory seemed within reach. \"All we are trying to do is to guarantee that if you are a fellow citizen of ours, and you are struck with illness or a loved one is, that you will never again have that fear, that you will end up losing your home, your job, your retirement and your life savings because you have been afflicted with an illness through no fault of your own.\"\nIf the Senate is able to pass a bill next week, it would be viewed as a major victory for President Obama. But the bill would still need to be reconciled with a health-care reform bill passed last month by the House of Representatives before the president could sign it into law next year.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The study is a groundbreaking attempt to gain insight into the spiritual lives and concerns of students and improve how faculties and administrators at US colleges and universities address this part of their students' lives.\nThe study, named The Spiritual Life of College Students,  was conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI), a research center of higher education in the United States.  HERI is based in the Graduate School of Education & Information Studies (GSE&IS) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  \nHERI also produces a widely-cited annual Survey of Entering Freshman through its Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) program.\nCo-Principal Investigators of the Project were Alexander Astin, Founding Director of HERI and widely-cited author of 20 books on higher education; and Helen Astin, psychologist, professor at UCLA, and author of 11 books and many articles on women, leadership and spirituality.  The study was funded by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.\nThe study has so far been undertaken in two major phases.  First a pilot survey was taken in Spring 2003 by 3,680 undergraduates at 46 US colleges and universities.\nResults from that survey were used to revise the questions, then the survey was given again in Fall 2004 to 112,232 students, the freshman classes of 236 US colleges and universities in the United States.  The study included both quantitative (multiple choice) and qualitative focus group interview approaches.  Copies of the questionnaires which were administered are available from the center's website.\nHERI also conducted a secondary survey of faculty to assess their spiritual beliefs in conjunction with this study.\nA follow-up survey of students is planned for Spring 2007 when they are expected to be juniors.\nGoals of the in-depth, multi-year project [1] are to:\nFor purposes of the study, the spiritual aspect under discussion was taken to refer to varying concepts such as traditional beliefs, mystical experiences, and a personal sense of meaning and values, in other words, \"our interiors, our subjective life, as contrasted to the objective domain of material events and objects.\" [2]\nThe differences and similarities in students' beliefs, activities and affiliations were examined along a number of dimensions, to assess the impact of the students beliefs on their daily lives.  The results are summarized below.  Note that the terms describing the various categories are taken verbatim from the survey results.  Note also that some of the percentages add to more than 100% because the answers were not mutually exclusive and more than one answer could be checked.\nThe survey offered 20 choices of religious affiliation of various kinds, which may be broadly classified as Christian sects, Buddhist, Islamic, Jewish, Other, and None.  The most numerous categories of response were:\nThe fact that the survey was administered only at US schools agrees with the expression of predominantly Christian opinion.\nHere is a quick summary of some of the major beliefs and interests of the students, that may be seen to indicate their overall level of involvement with such issues:\nSome of the findings in this area include:\nAlthough this percentage seems high, the proportion of US adults who pray is even greater at 82%, according to the Barna Group. [3] This fact is \"not surprising\" according to the author of the article in the Christian Science Monitor, given that college students are widely perceived as being hedonistic and less than serious.\nStudent's religious beliefs and affiliations were correlated with their political orientation in some predictable and some unexpected ways.\nUnexpectedly however, very religious students were found to be more likely to oppose the death penalty and affirmative action, but to hold generally similar views to less-religious or spiritually inclined students on issues of race and sex.\nThe study also noted \"sharp differences\" in areas such as legalized abortion, casual sex, same-sex marriage, and the legalization of marijuana based on the students' level of religiousness or spirituality.\nThe findings on religious tolerance seem consistent overall with the practice of reconciling contradictions of religious faith in a modern, pluralistic society.\nThe student's personal level of confidence in their own belief was also studied:\nThe survey also attempted to address how students feel about the role their schools should play in assisting their personal spiritual quest.\nThe results seem to indicate a substantial demand for greater support of student's religious and spiritual pursuits by the colleges and universities they attend.  This in turn suggests that future programs to address these kinds of needs may be developed at some colleges in response to the awareness raised by this study.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

In a complicated ruling, however, the judge also issued an order banning state officials from enforcing the law pending an appeal.\u00a0\nThe law, which was passed by the Illinois legislature in 1995, has never been enforced due to appeals. Last November, the\u00a0Illinois medical disciplinary board allowed the law to be enforced, but hours later Judge Daniel A. Riley granted a temporary restraining order filed by the\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois.\nWhen Judge Riley issued another ruling yesterday, he said the ACLU lawsuit was flawed, finding the law itself to be constitutional. He added, however, that \"the law in question is a rather unfortunate piece of legislation\" that is inherently discriminatory against pregnant minors.\u00a0\nACLU lawyers plan to file an appeal, which Judge Riley will rule on with a new restraining order in place. They argue that the law is an invasion of privacy and dangerous to minors who live in an abusive environment. The Illinois Attorney General's office is defending the law, saying that parents should be able to give their children advice on complicated matters.\u00a0\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

A man is in custody over the killing.\n67-year-old Tiller had been the target of many previous attacks. In 1986 his clinic was seriously damaged in a bombing and in 1993 he was shot in both arms. In 1991 his clinic saw summer-long protests that resulted in 2,000 arrests and he said that in 1994 he was put under police protection after FBI agents uncovered an anti-abortion 'hit list' naming him as a top target. The clinic was vandalized earlier this month.\nThe controversy stemmed from the fact that his clinic is one of just three in the United States that performed late-term abortions, which are abortions of fetuses which are capable of surviving outside of the womb. This is legal in Kansas so long as two doctors agree the mother is in serious danger if she were to give birth.\nTiller was recently tried on charges of performing nineteen illegal abortions in 2003; he was cleared of any wrongdoing at the end of a trial described by his lawyer as a 'witch-hunt'. It was alleged that there were irregularities and a financial involvement in his relationship with the doctor who gave second opinions in the abortions.\nAnother controversy was sparked by donations Tiller made to support Kathleen Sebelius, then governor of Kansas. The donations, coupled with Sebelius' abortion-rights views, caused anti-abortion groups to oppose her nomination as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, but the Senate confirmed her in a 65 to 31 vote in April.\nTiller was killed at 10 a.m. local time in the Reformation Lutheran in Wichita. A white man was witnessed with a handgun killing the doctor before fleeing in a blue Ford Taurus. The vehicle's number plate was traced to Kansas City, 200 miles from Wichita.\nState police and the FBI were involved in the hunt for the gunman.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost US$774 billion over 10 years and will cover 94% of Americans.  The Senate version was orchestrated by Senator Baucus, a Democrat from Montana.  The bill was released without any Republican support from the committee.  However, today, the bill received support from a bi-partisan group of Senators including the Republican Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Independent Joe Liberman.  If the bill's passage is determined along party lines, Democrats will need at least one Republican Senator to avoid a possible filibuster in the Senate.\nThe proposal mandates nation-wide individual insurance by 2013 and omits a government-run insurance clause as is included in the U.S. House version; instead, the plan calls for non-profit healthcare cooperatives.  The healthcare cooperatives would be provided with US$6 billion in initial funding to cover start-up fees and costs. Individuals refusing to obtain coverage can be charged up to US$950 annually with families fined up to US$3,800 per year.  Small businesses will not be mandated to provide healthcare to their employees but those who do will receive tax credits. Also, insurances companies that have more expensive individual plans will be taxed for 35% of the amount that that the plan exceeds the federal individual threshold of US$8,000 or the family threshold of US$21,000. The bill includes clauses for protection against coverage suspensions due to illnesses and protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. It will not pre-empt state laws on abortion and does not provide for abortion payments except in cases of rape or incest. The plan also mandates registration with the Social Security Administration as a means to avoid illegal alien use of the program.\nThe bill will reportedly be paid for by US$850 billion in spending reduction, taxes and fees to include reduction in Medicare benefits.  The Senate Finance Committee is the last approval authority before the Senate or House bills can be considered for floor debate.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

He has asked Congress to approve $225m in aid. Sudan and the biggest rebel group signed a peace deal last Friday to end the  three year old civil war, claiming more than 200,000 lives. \nCondoleezza Rice, US secretary of state will address the UN Security Council to help speed up the deployment of UN peacekeepers to the  Darfur region. \n\"She's going to request a resolution that will accelerate the deployment of UN peacekeepers into Darfur,\" President Bush said. \"We're now working with the UN to identify countries that contribute those troops, so the peacekeeping effort will be robust.\" \nThe Government of Sudan had previously denied UN deployment. But, after the signing of the peace treaty, they have expressed their keenness on the deployment of UN peacekeepers.\nSo far, there are around 7,000 African Union peacekeepers in Darfur, but they have failed to play any significant role to control the violence in the region. They are facing a serious shortage of funds and man-power. It had been two months since any soldier in the peacekeeping forces were paid, Nigerian envoy to the African Union confirmed yesterday.\nAmbassador Sam Ibok, Nigerian envoy to the AU said, \"There have been some cash flow problems, but that has been resolved now and troops will be paid in the next week or so. \"\nChad, Sudan's neighbouring state, welcomed the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement between the Sudanese government and the main faction of the rebel Sudan Liberation Movement.

Also, Chad withdrew its delegation from African Union-brokered peace talks for Sudan\u2019s troubled western Darfur region citing Sudanese aggression. Currently, there are more than 200,000 Darfur refugees. \nForeign minister Ahmat Allami said, \"Chad welcomes the signing of the Abuja peace deal on Darfur between the warring Sudanese parties after a long period of negotiations.\"\nLibya announced today that it would resume effort to normalize bilateral relations between Chad and Sudan.

Tsvangirai has often criticized Mbeki for failing to publicly condemn Robert Mugabe, and has repeatedly called for him to step down.\nTsvangirai says that \"no meaningful progress can be made toward resolving the Zimbabwe crisis\" if the SADC or the African Union does not appoint at least one other mediator. \"If this does not happen,\" he says, \"then the MDC will not be part of the mediation process.\" \nHe added, \"If dialogue is to be initiated, it is essential that ZANU-PF stops the violence, halts the persecution of MDC leaders and supporters.\" The MDC says that 9 of its supporters have been killed by the state since the run-off, bringing the death toll up to at least 95.\nEarlier on Tuesday, leaders at an African Union summit voiced their support for dialogue aimed at the creation of a unity government in Zimbabwe. \"We encourage President Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to honour their commitment to initiate dialogue with a view to promote peace, stability, democracy and reconciliation in Zimbabwe,\" the AU said in a statement.\nWhile the opposition rejected the idea of discussion, the Zimbabwe government called it a \"welcome resolution\", as stated by Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu. \"Government is ready for dialogue with anyone,\" he said, \"so long as it isn't dialogue concocted by the West.\" In his inauguration speech, Mugabe had said he was open to negotiations.\nTsvangirai believes that if a unified government were to be created, it should be based on the results of the original March 29 election, in which he received more votes but not enough to avoid a run-off. \"We remain committed to negotiations or talks, call them what you will, but they should be based on the fact that we won the last credible election on March 29,\" Tsvangirai said. \"Then we can move towards some transitional arrangement.\"\nThe European Union agrees with Tsvangirai on this point. Taking into account the March 29 vote, EU spokesman John Clancy says, \"it's clear that [Tsvangirai] should be a leading member of that government as its potential prime minister or the head of government to ensure that certain reforms can take place.\" The EU had been placing pressure on the African Union to take strong measures against Mugabe's government.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

According to the election commission, Jammeh gained 72% of the votes. Mustapha Carayol, electoral chairman, reported an 83% voter turnout. Carayol also stated Ousainou Darboe, the leader of the United Democratic Party, took 17% of the vote, while Hamat Bah, of the United Front coalition, received 11% of votes. Jammeh was confident that he would win this election, saying: \"There is no way I can lose unless you tell me that all Gambian people are mad\".\nDarboe has disputed the validity of these results, calling them \"bogus, fraudulent and preposterous\" and claimed that they \"constitute a capricious deception of the will of the people\". Before polling commenced, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) expressed concern about the fairness of the election and the freedom of Gambian voters. ECOWAS refused to send poll observers to monitor Gambia\u2019s vote; they cited \"intimidation, an unacceptable level of control of the electronic media by the party in power, the lack of neutrality of state and para-statal institutions, and an opposition and electorate cowed by repression and intimidation\" as reasons for their refusal to do so.\nBBC News Online has reported that the polling was overseen by observers representing the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the African Union (AU). According to Voice of America, AU members were satisfied with the organization of the poll and the conduct of voters. The head of the poll monitoring group at the AU reported: \"We didn\u2019t notice any intimidation anywhere. The policemen who were in the polling stations were not armed, and as much as possible tried to do their job without interfering with the process.\" Meanwhile, Carayol has contested the accusations of ECOWAS, stating that the Gambia election process is \"one of the fairest in the world\". Carayol explained: \"We use marbles; we don\u2019t use ballot papers, [and] we have very few invalid votes. All Gambians understand the system\". He insisted that Gambia elections \"are free and fair\".\nSamuel Fonkam, the chairman of ELECAM \u2014 Cameroon\u2019s Electoral Board \u2014 says members of the group did not witness any incidents of violence or intimidation in the approach to the election. Fonkam said that in all 24 constituencies they observed, \"the turnout was massive, orderly, peaceful and really serene\". The citizens of the Gambia \"demonstrated to those who wanted to see that they are the sovereign masters of their destinies,\" according to Fonkam.\nJammeh came to power of the Gambia in 1994 as the result of a bloodless coup in which he overthrew the previous president. Speaking about his presidency, Jammeh claimed: \"In 17 years, I have delivered more development [to Gambia] than the British were able to deliver in 400 years\".\nThe stance of the Jammeh government on civil liberties has attracted criticism from international rights groups, with particular disapproval drawn to the government's attitude towards freedom of the press, as well as the disappearance of journalists there and the detaining of journalists within the country. Jammeh responded to this criticism by stating: \"The journalists are less than 1% of the population and if anybody expects me to allow less than 1% of the population to destroy 99% of the population, you are in the wrong place.\"\nLast year, eight people accused of plotting Jammeh's overthrow were sentenced to death. In 2007, Jammeh claimed that the sexually transmitted infection AIDS could be cured through the use of a herbal concoction. In 2008, he said he would sentence homosexuals to execution by beheading. The three elections Jammeh previously won have also received a substantial amount of criticism.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Yesterday, Kouchner met with Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir.\nUntil Sunday, Chad had rejected the idea of allowing military troops in to assist with security at its border with Sudan. In Chad's eastern region, the government has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims has been supported by Sudan. While dealing with the insurgency, Chad had been amenable to an international police presence, but not a military force. \nAn estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees have fled the violence in the Darfur region of Sudan and crossed the border into Chad. In addition, Chad is coping with an estimated 150,000 internally displaced persons. The conditions in the camps set up to deal with the refugees have been criticised as inadequate by the aid group, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).\nFrance's newly appointed foreign minister, and co-founder of MSF, Bernard Kouchner, and Chad's President D\u00e9by were able to work out some concessions on the use of foreign troops. Following the meeting, D\u00e9by was asked by reporters whether he would allow UN or EU military troops to take a role in security and stabilization measures for a humanitarian mission. \"Why not,\" D\u00e9by replied.\nD\u00e9by revealed that plans for an international force for Chad would be made public by the end of June. \"We are agreed on the principle of deploying a force, but there are still some points to resolve, on which we must agree,\" said D\u00e9by. \"The results of the discussions will be made public before the 25th of this month.\"\n\"We have been proposing this to the international community since 2004,\" said D\u00e9by. But Chad's Prime Minister, Delwa Kassir\u00e9 Koumakoye, commented recently that neighbouring countries may take the use of foreign troops as a threat.\nOn June 9, MSF issued a press release warning of a humanitarian crisis developing in Chad. \"It is imperative that the emergency in eastern Chad be fully recognised, that aid organisations provide massive, immediate aid to the IDPs and that the Chadian authorities facilitate humanitarian aid,\" said Isabelle Defourny, manager of MSF programmes in Chad.\nFile:Bernard Kouchner.gif\nFollowing his visit to Chad, Foreign Minister Kouchner traveled to Sudan where he met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Sudan has, in the past, rejected the deployment of an international force, and has resisted the use of a UN-African Union (AU) force. During their meeting Monday, al-Bashir told Kouchner that he would only accept troops from Africa.\nKouchner indicated that his meetings with al-Bashir and other officials had been productive and would \"lift a certain number of complications\" in obtaining agreements with Sudan. He and al-Bashir also discussed the unilateral sanctions imposed on Sudan by the United States. Kouchner felt that the sanctions haven't been useful and that the Sudanese \"seem clearly affected by this issue, considering how much they raised it.\"\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed some optimism on the issue of troop deployment and acknowledged he received a letter recently from al-Bashir on the matter. As stated in the letter, al-Bashir has accepted in principal the idea of a UN-AU force of 23,000 troops to be stationed in Darfur. \"I sincerely hope that we will be able to have early resolution of this issue,\" said Ban.\nOne roadblock may be al-Bashir's refusal to accept any force other than African. The UN and AU stated they would attempt to use only African troops, but indicated that non-African troops may be used if that were not possible.\n\"Darfur cannot be only an African problem,\" said Kouchner. \"At a certain level, the respect for human rights concerns the whole world.\"\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

This falls short of the 1,000 beds an investigative team from WHO says is needed in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, alone.\nWHO says a three- to four-fold increase in the efforts of those combating the outbreak is needed.\nThe African Union also warned of the economic impact of the outbreak, urging a lifting of travel bans and border closures. WHO have previously warned that such travel restrictions increased the chance of food shortages. An agreement made yesterday is expected to lead to those restrictions imposed in the last few months being lifted.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

According to AU commission spokesperson Adam Thiam, \"They were taken by a dissident group of Jem.\" The Justice and Equality Movement, or Jem, is an Islamic rebel force deeply involved in the ongoing conflict in the region. \nOne day earlier two AU personnel and two civilians were killed in an attack believed to be perpetrated by the Sudan Liberation Army. A third soldier injured in the attack succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. Additionally, two personnel are missing and three others were injured.\nAccording to the AU, those who survived identified the attackers' vehicles and uniforms as belonging to the SLA. \nBoth rebel groups have been in conflict with the Sudanese government and its Arab militia (referred to as Janjaweed)  since 2003, although the roots of the violence stretch back to the first and second Sudanese Civil Wars.  Since the conflict began it is said that 180,000 people have been killed and 2 million have been forced to flee from their homes. The term genocide has been applied to the conflict although this has been hotly contested. The United Nations has come under intense criticism for refusing to refer to it as a genocide, something the United States has done. The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war-crimes in the region, although the Sudanese government denies the allegations.\n6,000 African Union troops have been dispatched to monitor a ceasefire between the opposing forces, and these latest attacks come on the heels of another round of peace talks. Although both sides have expressed optimism, the AU contends that progress is slow and blames divisions within the Sudan Liberation Army for holding up progress.\nThe AU has also accused the government of continuing attacks on villages and refugee camps. The Khartoum government denies this.  \nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

Security Council has approved the deployment of an African Union-led peace keeping force in Somalia for a period of six months.\nThe 15 member council met last Tuesday (February 20), and unanimously authorized Resolution 1744, allowing African Union member states to establish a mission in Somalia \"...to support dialogue and reconciliation in Somalia by assisting with the free movement, safe passage and protection\" of those involved in the national reconciliation congress, including the federal transition government led by Ali Mohammed Ghedi. \nOther goals will be to create the \"necessary security conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance\", and to secure key infrastructure. The mission has been designated as AMISOM, an acronym that stands for African Mission in Somalia.\nThe initiative for the national reconciliation congress was announced by Somalian President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed during a recent summit of the African Union. In the resolution text, the Council reminds that the congress needs a broad base, with representation of the diversity of the Somalian people.\nWhile exact numbers remain unknown, diplomatic sources spoke of some 8,000 troops that could be sent to the region, half of which would be provided by Burundi, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda. Ugunda would be the first to start with a phased operation to deploy their troops, some 1,500.\nEthiopia will not take part in AMISOM. The country's intervention in Somalia in December 2006, working together with forces loyal to Gedi, received much criticism. \nEthiopian prime minister Meles Zenawi, who recently announced the retreat of the army from Somalia, admitted that he didn't wish for his country to be present any longer, and that the war only served to protect Ethiopia from the Islamic Courts Union, which controlled until last December the largest part of the country, including the capital Mogadishu.\nFor the purpose of the mission, the Council has lifted the arms embargo in effect since 1992, which it says has helped greatly for peace and security in Somalia. States supplying weapons and supplies still need to inform the sanctions committee, adding that the Council intends to \"consider urgently\" ways to strengthen the embargo's effectiveness.\nAccompanying the resolution, the Security Council has asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \"to send a Technical Assessment Mission to the African Union headquarters and Somalia as soon as possible to report on the political and security situation and the possibility of a UN Peacekeeping Operation following the AU\u2019s deployment.\"\nThis is a complete or partial translation of the article \"Somalie\u00a0: le Conseil de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'ONU autorise l'intervention de l'Union africaine\", from the French language Wikinews, published under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a correction?

The U.N. chief is recently back from Africa where he attended the African Union summit in Ethiopia and met with leaders in Kenya.\nOn rebel efforts to overthrow the government in Chad in recent days, the secretary-general welcomed an African Union initiative to have the leaders of Libya and the Democratic Republic of Congo mediate the crisis. He says the United Nations will do its utmost to help resolve the crisis, urging the Security Council to act swiftly to help bring an end to the violence.\n\"It has devastating consequences not only for the people of Chad and Darfurian refugees seeking shelter there, but also for Darfur itself,\" said Ban.\nMr. Ban told reporters the situation in the neighboring Darfur region of Sudan is no less troubling. He says the deployment of the AU-U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNAMID, must be sped up and urged member states to properly equip the troops.\n\"UNAMID still lacks required aviation and ground transportation - chiefly helicopters. Additional troops will not make up for this shortfall,\" said Ban. \"Those countries that called for intervention in Darfur are under special obligation to deliver on their promises.\"\nWhile at the AU summit, Mr. Ban says he discussed some of the outstanding issues affecting the deployment with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, and he expects the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) to be signed this week. But Mr. Ban remained vague on whether some of the agreement's sticking points - such as night flights, land agreements, and advance notice of U.N. movements - had been settled.\nOn Kenya, Mr. Ban says he has been deeply engaged in the post-election crisis and told political leaders during his visit there that they bear particular responsibility for the future of Kenya.\n\"I stressed to all the Kenyan leaders the need to stop the unacceptable violence and killings, and to resolve their differences through dialogue and democratic process. I also appealed to all the political leaders to think beyond their individual interests or party lines and to look to the future of Kenya as one country,\" he said.\nMr. Ban also met in Nairobi with his U.N. predecessor, Kofi Annan, who is leading the panel of eminent Africans trying to mediate the crisis, and said they discussed his roadmap for the talks.\nSecurity of U.N. personnel in Africa and elsewhere has been high on the secretary-general's agenda, especially in the wake of the December bombing in Algeria that killed 17 staff members. Mr. Ban announced that he is naming diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi to chair an independent panel on safety and security of U.N. personnel and premises. Brahimi is an Algerian, but Mr. Ban says he has no concerns about his fairness or objectivity in heading up the panel.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The report also says the government is allowing militias such as the Janjaweed to act with impunity, and that government forces are even operating jointly with the militia. The militias themselves and the armed rebel groups aren't spared either; they are accused of serious violations of human rights and international law.\nDuring their month of work, the researchers didn't actually get into Sudan because they were not given visas, but they interviewed hundreds of relevant people (such as refugees), and reviewed thousands of pages from documents on the humanitarian situation in Darfur.\nTo summarise the situation, the 35-page documents says: \"Today, millions are displaced, at least 200,000 are dead, and conflict and abuse are spilling over the border into Chad.\" The report says that humanitarian and human rights workers are increasingly being targeted, especially during the past six months. \"Killing of civilians remains widespread, ... Rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic. Torture continues.\" The experts think the conflict could destabilise the region.\nThe mission advises the U.N. General Assembly to \"request the compilation of a list of foreign companies that have an adverse impact on the situation of human rights in Darfur.\" The U.N. agencies should then cease to do business with these companies.\nSudanese officials declined to respond to the report immediately, saying that the response will be made in Sudan's address to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday. Just days ago, Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir rejected an interim U.N. plan to bolster African Union peacekeeping forces in Darfur. Up to 24,000 troops were to replace the current 7,000 African Union peacekeepers in the western Sudan region.\nThe almost 4-year-old Darfur conflict is being fought between the Janjaweed militia (Arabic for \"devils on horseback\"; they are camel-herding Arabs) and a group of mostly land-tilling tribes. The Sudanese government in the past denied allegations against them, blaming the rebels who didn't sign the peace treaty of 2006. The International Criminal Court in The Hague has already summoned a junior minister of the Sudan, and a militia leader, to answer war crime charges. The government in Khartoum refused to extradite anyone, saying the people responsible would be tried in the Sudan itself.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a correction?

WFP says the attacks constrain its ability to feed the more than two million people in the area receiving aid. \nNegotiations over a UN Security Council resolution authorising a joint UN-African Union security force for the region continue but full deployment could take up to a year.\n\"In the last two weeks, nine food convoys have been attacked by gunmen across Darfur,\" said Kenro Oshidari, WFP Sudan Representative. \"WFP staff and contractors are being stopped at gunpoint, dragged out of their vehicles and robbed with alarming frequency,\" he said. \n\"These abhorrent attacks, which target the very people who are trying to help the most vulnerable in Darfur, must be brought under control,\" he added.\nA WFP official told Wikinews that the attacks and robberies have occurred in all regions of Darfur, and that the blame can't be ascribed to a particular group. \"Frequently the bandits are wearing uniforms but often in one group of bandits there may be more than one uniform. Thus, we are not pointing fingers at any one group.\" said Emilia Casella, WFP Spokesperson for Sudan. \"We are calling on all parties to respect the neutrality of humanitarian convoys and their drivers, who are delivering food to civilians who are victims of the conflict.\"\n\u2014Emilia Casella, WFP Spokesperson for SudanAccording to WFP, in 2007 so far, 18 WFP convoys have been attacked - \"shot at, looted, drivers robbed and/or injured\". Four vehicles were stopped and the drivers and passengers robbed. Six vehicles were stolen, where the gunmen drove away with the WFP staff members still inside, though they were later released. \"There were no major physical injuries, but naturally such experiences are very traumatic,\" said Casella. \"These incidents have occurred in all three of the Darfurs, in areas controlled by various groups or the government.\"\nIn the week of July 15-21, there were five incidents in South Darfur, during which a total of seven trucks were looted of approximately 10.5 tonnes of food assistance.\nThe Darfur operation is the WFP's largest humanitarian mission, with about 790 staff working to feed more than two million people every month.\nThe WFP indicated that it has been difficult to hire and retain the commercial trucking companies used to move food and supplies throughout the region due to the risks involved in the service. WFP Public Affairs Officer in Washington D.C. Jennifer Parmelee told Wikinews that \"hiring reliable transport in other insecure environments, [such as] Afghanistan and Somalia, is extremely challenging.\"\nAir service is employed for remote locations and where delivery by road has become too dangerous.\nParmelee told Wikinews that the \"increasing insecurity will almost certainly further constrain [WFP's] ability to operate in Darfur - it already has.\" WFP Spokesperson for Sudan, Emilia Casella, indicated that \"humanitarian access is likely to be increasingly difficult due to insecurity.\" However, the situation has not prevented all aid delivery. \"Despite insecurity and access problems, WFP food assistance reached about 2.6 million people in Darfur last month,\" said Casella.\nA UN resolution on the deployment of a hybrid African Union (AU) and UN force of 26,000 troops is working its way through the UN. Britain and France presented revisions to the draft, which dropped a threat of \"further measures\" against Sudan for obstructing peace efforts, though Sudan's ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, has objected to the revisions.\nA deadline of December 31 exists to transfer authority in Sudan's Darfur region from the AU to the proposed AU-UN force. Full deployment of all 26,000 troops would take up to one year.\nThe draft resolution would allow the use of force to protect the mission's personnel and humanitarian workers and would \"protect civilians under threat of physical violence\".\nJennifer Parmelee of the WFP suggests that the deployment of the hybrid force under such a mandate would be a positive development in the aid agency's ability to carry out their humanitarian assistance. \"Sure an expanded AU/UN peacekeeping force would help.\" said Parmelee. \"As it is, AU is stretched very very thin, and...is unable to accompany most of our convoys.\"\nAccording to WFP, there are approximately 12,000 humanitarian workers in Darfur, which is a drop in numbers even though the need for aid workers has increased. \nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

So far only around 10,000 of that planned mission have been ordered to the region.

The latest dispute between the two involved efforts to reconcile with the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS), the country's main opposition group. The UN-sponsored peace process has been decried by Yusuf as dealing with terrorists.\nHussein countered that the president had no authority to strip the prime minister of his post, and that the transitional federal charter required the approval of parliament for such an action. \"The president was speaking in his usual personal capacity, contrary to the rules and regulations,\" Hussein said prior to the special parliamentary session in Baidoa.\nDespite Yusuf's hope that the parliament would endorse his decision, members of parliament were strongly supportive of Hussein's government, with 143 members recognizing the government's legitimacy, 20 rejecting its legitimacy and 7 abstaining. \"Therefore the government of Hassan Hussein is legitimate,\" said Aden Mohamed Nur, the parliamentary speaker.\nHussein, whom Yusuf appointed little more than a year ago after the resignation of Ali Mohamed Gedi, had previously survived a vote of no confidence in September, when he faced accusations of embezzling state funds. \n\"The only obstacle in front of my government was the president,\" Hussein told members of parliament after the vote, \"and since I have the confidence of the MPs I hope it will be effective henceforth.\" Yusuf had no immediate comment on the vote, but he had previously stated he would comply with parliament's decision if they chose to block his dismissal.\nThe relationship between the president and prime minister has grown increasingly strained over the issue of Islamic militancy. Yusuf has blamed the prime minister for the instability plaguing the politically fragile state, while Hussein has accused the president of trying to \"sabotage\" peace efforts between the transitional government and the ARS. Fighting between the Islamic opposition and Somali-backed troops from Ethiopia, the African Union, and the UN has killed thousands of Somalis and displaced millions.\nJean Ping, chairman of the African Union Commission, said the dispute within the transitional government has the potential of undermining efforts for \"further reconciliation, peace, and stability in Somalia.\" The UN also issued a statement condemning the dispute, and demonstrators gathered in the streets of Mogadishu to denounce the president's move.\nAlthough moderate Islamists from the ARS have agreed to enter into reconciliation talks, hardliner insurgents have rejected the attempts at peace and continue to take over towns in the central and northern regions of Somalia. Since the fall of the Islamic Courts Union, organizations like Al-Shabaab have become leading insurgent groups. A spokesman for Al-Shabaab told reporters on Sunday that they intend to impose Sharia law on all of Somalia, and that a peace deal would never be accepted.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

He stated that he would remove Senegalese troops from the AU force if the investigation found the pacificators were unequipped to defend themselves.  \nIn what was called \"...the heaviest loss of life and biggest attack on the African Mission,\" by AU spokesperson Noureddine Mezni, 30 vehicles and a force of 1,000 armed rebels raided the AU base in the town of Haskanita just after sunset on Saturday. The base was completely destroyed.  One of the soldiers killed in the attack was Senegalese, while the majority were Nigerian.  One Malian soldier, and one soldier from Botswana were also killed in the raid, according to AU spokesman Assane Ba.\n\"If they died because they didn't have the arms to defend themselves, I will withdraw all the Senegalese ... I am not going to send people to be slaughtered,\" said President Wade.  This would strike a heavy blow to the AU mission in Darfur, as Senegalese troops make up one of the largest sections of the peacekeeping force.  \nThe United Nations also spoke out vehemently against the attack on Monday.   UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the rebels in the \"...strongest possible terms,\", while simultaneously urging a renewed commitment to peace in preparation for the scheduled October peace talks in Libya.     \nThe AU has been bemoaning their lack of sufficient funds in Darfur for years, citing a lack of military helicopters, rapid response vehicles, and an inadequate number of troops which hinder the force in their mission to improve the stability of the region.\n\"People did deployment on the premise that there was an (peace) agreement and they were coming to inspect and act as observers -- there was no planning for people to be able to defend themselves,\" AU force commander Martin Agwai said.  In addition, he said that while the AU was in the process of creating new emergency security plans, not much more could be done without an increase to the funds and troop levels of the bases in Darfur.  This will hopefully come with the deployment of the hybrid United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) force by the end of the year, which will raise the troop levels from 7,000 to 26,000 soldiers.\nAs for the interim time period, Agwai added that, \"We peacekeepers are determined to continue,\".\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Mugabe, who had previously shown little interest in talks with the opposition, said at a campaign rally, \"Should we emerge victorious ... we will be magnanimous and say 'let's sit down and talk,' and talk we shall.\" \nEarlier on Thursday, Tsvangirai said he would not participate in discussion after the election is held. \"If the sham election goes ahead and Mugabe elects himself, how can I or the MDC negotiate with him?\" Tsvangirai said in an interview with Britain's The Times. \"In essence, we'll be negotiating with an illegitimate leader and we won't do that.\"\nMugabe left the offer for the MDC to either accept or reject, while warning against outside interference from the African Union. \"The moment the outside world starts dictating, we will not proceed,\" he said. Mugabe also said that violence had been committed by his ZANU-PF party as well as Tsvangirai's party, and that the violence must stop.\nDeputy Information Minister Bright Matonga later clarified the president's comments. \"What the president is saying to the MDC is that 'You are Zimbabweans. We want you to be part of this. We are willing to talk to you but let's finish this first.\" Matonga did not say how soon after the election the talks would take place.\nMany southern African leaders have called for Zimbabwe to postpone the election, but Matonga says to do so would be illegal. \"The president has said today that the election will go ahead because to postpone it would violate Zimbabwe's laws and he won't do that,\" he said.\nTsvangirai had been the only candidate facing Mugabe in the run-off election, before he announced on Sunday that he was withdrawing due to the threat of government-sponsored violence and intimidation against his party. Despite his withdrawal, election officials say his name will remain on the ballot, as they assert he missed the deadline to pull out.\nWhile Tsvangirai fled to the Dutch Embassy for safety, other opposition members fled to the South African Embassy. Many opposition members have questioned South African president Thabo Mbeki's unwillingness to denounce Mugabe. Meanwhile, they welcomed the words of former South African president Nelson Mandela, who yesterday spoke of Zimbabwe's \"tragic failure of leadership\" at a London fundraiser.\nZimbabwe's government dismissed Mandela's remarks, calling them a result of pressure from Western nations like Britain and the United States. Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said, \"I am condemning all Westerners for putting pressure on Mandela,\" while at the same time calling Mandela a \"courageous\" statesman. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai said his party appreciates Nelson Mandela's criticism. \"It is something we cherish,\" he said.\nDuring his campaign, Tsvangirai has been detained by police a total of five times, and his party's second-in-command, Tendai Biti, was charged with treason and publishing false statements. Biti was today granted bail after paying 1 trillion Zimbabwean dollars (USD$100) and surrendering his passport and the title to his home. He also must report to police twice a week.\n\nHave an opinion on this story? Share it!\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

After the resignation was announced to the opposition, four Army generals and a head of the church were detained for reasons unknown. The true extent of the Army's loyalty to Mr Rajoelina is unclear, as reportedly the military refused to arrest President Ravalomanana despite orders from Mr Rajoelina.\nMr Rajoelina installed himself in the Presidential Palace in upper Antananarivo, which troops had seized yesterday. A cabinet loyal to him has been in operation since the end of January, when Mr Rajoelina proclaimed Mr Ravalomanana's rule to be illegitimate. The Madagascan opposition accuses Mr Ravalomanana of mismanaging the country while restricting personal freedoms.\nPresident Ravalomanana was reportedly first announced via an text message from one of his aides before being confirmed by Ravalomanana's office in a radio broadcast, in which the President proclaimed, \"After deep reflection, I have decided to dissolve the government and give up power so that a military directorate can be established\". Madagascan Army Chief of Staff Colonel Andre Ndriarijaona has declared his support for Rajoelina and says that \"99% of the forces are behind\" the opposition leader.\nThe African Union, meanwhile, reiterated its position that a military takeover in Madagascar would be considered a coup d'etat, which could result in \"firm measures\" such as Madagascar's suspension from the organization or a blocking of international aid, and urged the military to obey the country's constitution, which bars Mr Rajoelina from the presidency due to his age, and not hand power over to the former mayor, instead suggesting that power could be given to Madagascan Prime Minister General Charles Rabemananjara. Members of the Madagascan opposition say they plan to re-write the constitution and electoral code before holding new elections within two years.\nWhile reports are that the country has been overall stable during the coup, the unrest of the past two months has deprived the country of tourist revenue. Tourism, especially eco-tourism highlighting the country's rainforests and unique mammal species, brings $800 million annually to the Madagascan economy.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

But they could not avoid sparring over some older issues involving human rights and conflict on the continent. \nThe president of the European Union, Portugal's Prime Minister Jose Socrates, closed the summit today, saying African and European leaders have turned a new page in history.  He says the leaders have adopted an agenda to confront serious challenges of security, governance, migration and climate change.\nNevertheless, long-standing disagreements re-emerged during the two-day meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, in her speech on governance and human rights, accused Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe of harming Africa's image by quashing political freedom and human rights in his country.\nMr. Mugabe was invited to the summit despite being banned from Europe five years ago because of rigged elections in his country. His attendance prompted a boycott by the prime minister of Britain, Gordon Brown, the former colonial power in Zimbabwe.\nThe head of the African Union, Ghana's President John Kufuor, responded to Ms. Merkel's remarks by noting that South African President Thabo Mbeki is mediating talks between Zimbabwe's ruling party and the opposition in an effort to bring free and fair elections next year.\n\"It is not for anybody to just move in there and impose a solution,\" he said. \"We want to encourage a home-grown solution so there will be a restoration of normalcy and good governance for the people of Zimbabwe.\"\nSeveral European leaders met with Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir and strongly urged him to allow the deployment of U.N. and A.U. troops to end bloodshed and suffering in its Darfur region. Sudan has accepted this hybrid force, but has rejected troops from non-African countries.\nMr. Kufuor said Africa has taken the initiative on the issue, though he acknowledged it has taken some time to assemble the hybrid force.\n\"I believe with good will all around the hybrid force will be put together so at least humanitarian actions can be brought to the people of Darfur,\" added Mr. Kufuor.\nAfrican leaders also objected to the E.U. efforts to forge temporary trade agreements with developing nations, which they say will unleash excessive competition on their emerging economies. The European Union says these are needed because existing accords are due to expire at the end of this month.\nE.U. Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso noted that these are temporary agreements that are meant to maintain tariff exemptions for African exports to the European Union.\n\"Once we have settled this transitional phase, we [will] have the time and the spirit to address development issues and important concerns that were raised also from the African Union side,\" said Barroso.\nHe said he believes that all but a few African governments will sign the interim accords by the end of the year.\nThe leaders agreed to hold their next summit in a couple of years on African soil. \n\nHave an opinion on this story?

For example, Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations, yesterday called for the election to be postponed. He said that he \"strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC (Southern African Development Community) that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed.\" \nMugabe yesterday claimed the current results show that he will have a 'sweeping victory' in the unopposed presidential run-off elections. He announced his victory on one of the state run television networks. \"The returns show that we are winning convincingly, that we have won in all the 26 constituencies in Harare, an MDC stronghold where we won in only one constituency in March.\" \nAs an African Union summit began in Egypt today, Mugabe took his seat among other African heads of state hours after declaring victory in the election. His appearance at the summit generated different reactions, from being hailed as a \"hero\" by the President of Gabon, to U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro's remarks calling the situation in Zimbabwe \"an extremely grave crisis\".\nMugabe, now in his sixth term as President, arrived in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday. Despite criticism from the African Union's election observers, who said the election fell short of their standards, Mugabe was reportedly warmly received at the summit. One delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mugabe was seen hugging other African leaders after the opening session.\nDelegates at the convention discussed the elections, but largely avoided direct criticism of Mugabe or the government. Jakaya Kekwete, the Tanzanian President chairing the summit, said, \"We would like to congratulate the Zimbabwean people for their successes but we would also like to express our commiserations for their suffering.\" A draft resolution being considered for adoption on Tuesday calls for negotiations and an end to violence, but also does not directly criticize Mugabe or the election.\nGeorge Sibotshiwe, a spokesman for Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change, said he hopes that the summit would take stronger measures during Tuesday sessions. \"I would hope that the nature of what happened in Zimbabwe warrants a strong response and a lot of the leaders are taking our problems into consideration,\" he said.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

This comes after Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki sent an envoy to brief the Ghanaian president, who is also chairman of the African Union on the current situation in Kenya. Kibaki has also reportedly said he is willing to dialogue without pre-condition with opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Orange Democratic Movement who is claiming he won December\u2019s presidential election. Odigna has decided to call off protests that were due to take place tomorrow as a result of the action. He has agreed to take part in the  mediation process. This is despite earlier reports that he would not take part in the mediation.\nAkwasi Osei-Adjei is Ghana\u2019s foreign minister. He tells VOA reporter Peter Clottey that President Kufuor is concerned about the tensions in Kenya.\n\u201cBasically, the president has been invited to Kenya to see for himself the situation and offer advise as to how the two leaders can come together to stop what is happening in Kenya. As you know, people are being killed and there are a lot of disturbances in Kenya and Kenya is like a pillar of a democratic country is now blowing up in our faces. And I don\u2019t think it is for any African country to stand by and more so the chair of the AU (Africa Union) to sit by for such a thing to happen to Kenya. He (president Kufuor) is going there to offer advice,\u201d Osei-Adjei noted.\nHe reckoned that President Kufuor\u2019s expected trip would yield positive results that would help alleviate the escalating violence in Kenya.\n\u201cWe hope so. He (President Kufuor) wouldn\u2019t move from Ghana to Kenya not expecting to make a difference to make the situation calm and normal. You know so that is what we expect,\u201d he said.\nOsei-Adjei denied speculations that President Kufuor\u2019s mediation efforts could possibly worsen the situation just like in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Zimbabwe is quite a different issue. This is coming out as a result of elections, the recent elections and what is happening that we have to be there to ensure that the two leaders can sit down and then calm the situation,\u201d Osei-Adjei pointed out.\nHe said President Kibaki invited the Ghanaian president to help solve the escalating violence, which is blamed on the controversy surrounding the December elections.\n\u201cWell, the envoy came yesterday to brief the president of Ghana and at the same time the chair of the AU the situation before elections, during elections and after the elections. Upon this then he also added the President (Kibaki) has also asked him to invite the president of Ghana that is President Kufuor of Ghana to be there to help calm the situation. This is what was said yesterday that President Kufuor is going to Kenya to talk to the two leadership and then make them come to if you like some the peace pipe so that things in Kenya will calm down so that of course the necessary things could be done, and then ensure that people go about their normal businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The talks received a boost after the leaders of the government and opposition reached a power sharing agreement. \nAfter breaking the deadlock over power sharing, negotiators for the Kenyan government and opposition began to focus on resolving what are seen as long-term solutions to Kenya's crisis, namely constitutional reform, land distribution and poverty.\nThe talks took on a new vitality after President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga signed a power sharing accord in the presence of chief mediator Kofi Annan, Chairman of the African Union Jakaya Kikwete and the Nairobi diplomatic corps.\nMr. Kibaki said he would convene parliament next Thursday to begin debate on the constitutional amendments needed to implement the accord. The speaker of parliament, Kenneth Marende, said he does not anticipate any difficulties in passing the constitutional changes.\n\"There must be a bill prepared by the government, a bill which will then be tabled in parliament,\" said Marende. \"After it is tabled in parliament it will then be moved in the normal manner and it will be debated and voted for.\"\nOpposition parliament member Ababu Namwamba noted that the Kenyan constitution currently allows parliament to change the constitution with a two-thirds majority vote. He said this should not be difficult to muster given the broad support for the agreement.\n\"The main obstacle will be political brinkmanship and hardliners that may crop up,\" said Namwamba. \"But otherwise, if every side maintains the goodwill that has been demonstrated by the two principals, then I do not foresee any difficulty in the implementation of this deal.\"\nThe agreement calls for the creation of the post of prime minister who will supervise the ministries and can only be dismissed by a majority vote in parliament. Mr. Odinga is expected to assume this post.\nThe accord also calls for the distribution of ministerial posts according to the relative strength of each party in parliament.\nThe African Union, Britain, and the United States welcomed the agreement saying they hope it will bring peace and reconciliation to the country.\nKenyans reacted with spontaneous street celebrations in some cities, although some cautioned that similar deals in previous years ended up in failure.\nOne thousand people were killed and several hundred thousand were displaced by violence that erupted after Mr. Kibaki was declared the winner of a presidential election which the opposition says was rigged. \n\nHave an opinion on this story?

In the past four years, the rebel movement has splintered into more than 15 disparate groups, some of which are nothing more than armed outlaws.  \nSLM leader Abdel Wahed Mohammed el-Nur has  refused to take part in the negotiations until a UN force is deployed in Darfur, and the pro-government militias are disarmed.\nHe has also chastised the choice of location of the peace talks, saying his group was not consulted and that a more neutral site should have been chosen. \n\"Even if we were to attend the negotiations it will not be Tripoli,\" he said. \"We think that any negotiation is supposed to happen in a place which is not related to the conflict.\"  Libya has been an important influence in the Darfur conflict.  They are believed to have first armed militias with weapons and Pan-Arab ideology in the 1980's, militias which became the current Janjaweed. \nMeanwhile, Andrew Natsios, the US Special Envoy to Sudan, has said that the relationship between the governments of north and south Sudan is growing increasingly toxic.  He added that the two-year-old Comprehensive Peace Agreement would have to be discussed at the peace talks before the situation grew more dire.  The agreement, signed in 2005, was aimed at bringing the two governments together as allies and partners in peace.  \nMr. Natsios said that this has not happened, and that the north and south Sudanese governments are still opponents unable to find common ground.\n\"We are deeply concerned with the health of the CPA. The important deadlines have been missed... and trust is slowly being lost,\" said Mr. Natsios.\nSpeculation on the peace talks also includes questions about the deployment of the 26,000 strong force of The United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID).  The deployment of the force has been delayed because Khartoum and the AU have rejected non-African troops, and not enough African nations with well-trained and well-equipped soldiers have pledged to help.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Two smaller rebel groups rejected it despite last-minute efforts to get their support. \nThe deal, which followed intense talks in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, calls for the disbandment of rebel forces and the disarmament of the pro-government Janjaweed militia. The conflict had killed about 200,000 and left about two million homeless. The accord, initiated by the African Union, was reached after two years of negotiations.\n\"I accept the document with some reservations concerning the power sharing,\" Mr Minnawi said. The SLM are the largest rebel group in the Darfur region of Sudan. One of his officials told that the SLM wanted more seats in parliament but had agreed to the deal to end the suffering of the people in Darfur.\nTwo smaller groups said they were not happy with the terms of the deal. The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) said it wanted fundamental changes to the document. The group's chief negotiator, Ahmed Tugod, reiterated the rebels' demands for the post of vice-president in the Khartoum government, to have the allocation of 6.5 percent of Sudan's national income to a Darfur development fund, and for greater representation in national institutions.  \n\"We decided not to sign it unless fundamental changes are made to this document, it did not meet a series of key demands.\" Mr Tugod said. \nThe other faction of Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) likewise refused to sign it. \"We need the document to be improved upon,\" the group's spokesman Abdel wahid Muhamed El Nur said. \nRebel negotiators faced intense pressure to accept the amended deal, as diplomats from the United States, Britain, Canada and the European Union struggled to find common ground. The initial deadline for the peace talks was Sunday at midnight, but was extended thrice. The peace plan was prepared by mediators from the African Union and was amended after the rebel groups did not agree at an early draft. International negotiators, including U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and British International Development Secretary Hilary Benn, said the deal was the best hope for peace in Darfur.\nThe new plan decided to:\nObservers said failure to reach an agreement would have been disastrous for the people of Darfur, who have suffered through three years of conflict that has claimed 200,000 lives and driven more than 2 millions from their homes. The conflict began in the arid and impoverished region early in 2003 after a rebel group began attacking government targets, claiming the capital Khartoum was neglecting the region. The rebels said the government was oppressing black Africans in favour of Arabs.\nOn the other side, Arab Janjaweed militias, drawn from Arab tribes, had been conducting a campaign of destruction with alleged help from the government. To flush out the rebels they had allegedly been targeting innocent civilians. More than 90 villages were burnt and destroyed, millions have fled their destroyed villages, with many heading for camps near Darfur's main towns. But there was not enough food, water or medicine. The Janjaweed patrol outside the camps and Darfurians said the men were killed and the women were raped if they venture too far in search of firewood or water. Many women were reported being abducted by the Janjaweed and held as sex slaves for more than a week before being released. Some 200,000 had also sought safety in neighbouring Chad, but many of them were camped along a 600km stretch of the border and remain vulnerable to attacks from Sudan. Chad was worried that the conflict could spill over the border. Its eastern areas have a similar ethnic make-up to Darfur.\nDarfur, which means land of the Fur, has the history of tensions for many years over land and grazing rights between the mostly nomadic Arabs, and farmers from the Fur, Massaleet and Zagawa communities. \nHuman rights groups said that genocide was taking place, though a UN investigation team sent to Sudan said that while war crimes had been committed, there had been no intent to commit genocide. In April 2006, the UN Security Council passed a resolution imposing sanctions against four Sudanese nationals accused of war crimes in Darfur that include two rebel leaders, a former air force chief, and a Janjaweed militia leader. \nSudan's government denied being in control of the Janjaweed and President Omar al-Bashir called them \"thieves and gangsters\". After strong international pressure and the threat of sanctions, the government promised to disarm the Janjaweed. But so far there was little evidence that this had been implemented. Thousands of extra policemen were deployed but the refugees had little faith in the Sudanese security forces. Some 7,000 African Union troops had slowly been deployed in Darfur on a very limited mandate. Experts said the soldiers were too few to cover the whole area, and the African Union said it did not have the money to fund the operation for much longer. Sudan was unhappy with suggestions that the UN take control of the peacekeeping mission. \nMany aid agencies working in Darfur were unable to get access to vast areas because of the fighting. They said a peace agreement is vital before the rainy season begins in June when planting of food crops must be completed. United Nations officials, meanwhile, warned that they would be unable to provide food and other aid to the more than two million people living in refugee camps unless the security situation improves.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a correction?

Madagascan President Marc Ravalomanana, whose I Love Madagascar party controls an overwhelming majority of seats in the National Assembly, was not in the palace and is said to be taking shelter in another palace six miles (10 km) from the site.\n\"The President of the Republic, the National Assembly and the Senate, and the government are removed from their duties,\" announced declaration signed by opposition leader Andry Rajoelina which also said new elections would be held within two years. Earlier in the day, Rajoelina, the former mayor of Antananarivo and head of the Tanora malaGasy Vonona movement, had called for President Ravalomanana to be arrested, rejecting the President's offer of a plebiscite on his rule. The occupation of the palace follows a long chain of events which includes Mr Rajoelina's January 31 declaration that he would \"run all national affairs\" of the country. Mr Rajoelina has been publicly supported in turn by the self-proclaimed chief of staff of the Army and it was unclear as of this writing whether he or the military were leading the coup, and Mr Rajoelina denied ordering the attack on the palace.\nPresident Ravalomanana, in response, called for the people of the outskirts of the capital to \"organise themselves to thwart all movements of mutinous troops towards the palace in order to protect the president and the palace\" on his private radio station.\nThe African Union, which has been urging both sides to come to the negotiating table during the several months of unrest which has led to the deaths of over one hundred Madagascans, condemned the attempted coup, urging the country to respect its constitution; that constitution bars Mr Rajoelina, who is 34, from the presidency for reasons of age.\nMr Rajoelina argues that under President Ravalomanana, freedoms in the country are being suppressed while large areas of land have been unfairly given over to foreign interests.\nPresident Ravalomanana, meanwhile, has also accused Mr Rajoelina of being a puppet of former Madagascan president Didier Ratsiraka, whose refusal to leave power in 2001 after losing an election led to eight months of demonstrations.\nThe coup follows a number of legal rebuffs for Mr Rajoelina, who lost the mayorship after his January declaration of power and whose attempt to challenge the legitimacy of President Ravalomanana was rejected by the Madagascan Constitutional Court.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The battle raged on for hours, according to sources. The al-Shabaab group claimed responsibility for the attack.\nTwelve civilians were killed in the incident, while 25 were injured. The Hodan Wardhigley and Howl Wadag districts were the worst hit. Medical authorities claimed that the deaths had occurred when mortar fire had burnt their houses. The fire came from both the insurgents and the peace-keepers, according to the officials. Ali Musa, one of the officials of a volunteer ambulance service in Mogadishu, said that a mother and her two children had died during the firing.\nThe attack commenced on 2 AM, Friday. Awakened by mortar explosions, residents hid inside their houses, while others left for safer places. The battle went on for hours and the sound of the firing emanated to all parts of the Somali capital.\nThis was the most intense fighting in months, claim residents. \"I thought I was dreaming when I heard the sound of the artillery,\" said Asha Abdulle, Mogadishu resident, while Ahmed Hashi said that the fighting was the \"worst in months.\" Nurta Hussein, another resident said: \"We were woken up by the explosions at 2 a.m. and haven't slept since because of the non-stop shelling. Two mortar bombs landed in this neighborhood, killing four civilians and wounding six.\"\n\u2014Nurta Hussein, resident of MogadishuAlmost 20,000 Somali civilians have died since 2007, as a result of multiple insurgent attacks. Almost 1.5 million have been forced to leave the country since that time.\nThe al-Shabab as well as another group, called Hizbul Islam, claimed responsibility in a statement they released. They successfully attacked \"the strongholds of the enemies of Allah,\" claimed the statement. \"The mujahideen attacked AMISOM and government bases last night and we killed some of their troops. When we pulled back, AMISOM began intentionally shelling residential areas. We shall keep on targeting them,\" said the attackers. However Somali officials called the attack \"small and careless.\"\nMogadishu's \"Kilometer Four\" area was one of those affected. It includes a square that connects the airport to the port. While the area has been attacked several times previously, this attack is said to be the worst. African Union peace-keepers from Uganda are posted there.\nThe fighting comes almost a year since Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was sworn in as the nation's new president.\nAl-Shabaab is considered a terrorist body by the United States; the latter blames it for multiple attacks, shootings and bombings inside Somalia.\nAl-Shabaab has also threatened other African countries, including Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Eritrea, Ghana, Sudan and Uganda.\nAn African Union soldier, on a condition of anonymity, said that one Ugandan soldier was killed in the clash. He added that another soldier was wounded. A Somali government official backed this claim. Earlier, on Monday, two AU soldiers had died in another mortar attack in an AU clinic.\nWhen contacted through telephone, Somalia's Defence Minister, Sheikh Yusuf Mohammad Siad, who is a former warlord (also known as \"Inda'ade\" or \"white eyed\") said more than ten insurgents had died in the clash.\nParts of the Shabaab group have connections with al-Qaeda. The former has regularly attacked different parts of Somalia, with suicide bombers and several insurgents, taking advantage of the weak political and military infrastructure of the country.\nThe incident occurred exactly an year following President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed election to the parliament. The government was set to celebrate its first anniversary with a parade and poetry recitations at the presidential palace, named Villa Somalia. It was not known whether the attack intentionally collided with this event. However, it was a reminder of Somalia's weak military power; the army was heavily dependent on the African troops in this attack as well.\nFor over two decades, the country has had no central government. This has led to warlords ruling the nation, which often suffers from attacks by militant groups and pirate ships.\nDuring an African Union (AU) summit Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, Ali Jama' Jangeli, Somali Foreign Minister, requested more African Union troops to assist other soldiers in the capital. Both Kenya and Sudan backed Jangeli; Djibouti answered the call and promised to send 450 soldiers soon.\n\"The situation in Somalia is very grim, it is very precarious. It is threatening stability in the whole of the east Africa region and the Horn of Africa. It is in our interest as a region ... also in the interest of Africa to contribute more troops to Somalia so that there is law and order in Somalia,\" claimed Jangeli's Sudanese counterpart, Deng Alor.\nThe United States and Western nations are supportive of Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed's government, amidst fears that Somalia would become a base for al-Qaeda and other such organizations. However, the Somali government controls only few city blocks in the country.\nApart from attacks on government forces, the militants have also bombed the country's principal airport. There also has been an explosion during a college graduation ceremony, claim civilians.\nWestern nations have spent millions of dollars to buy weapons and ammunition for the Somali army. However, since the Shabab group controls a significant part of the country, the Somali government has had limited success. The group has won several battles and displaced millions of Somali people.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The IMF was originally founded in 1946 as the overseer of the Bretton Woods system, which from its founding until the 1970s tied the western world's currencies to the US Dollar, which was in turn backed by gold. Russia's proposal was for the new currency to serve as a reserve currency, one which would take the place of the dollar, euro, and other heavily-traded currencies as an international standard of exchange.\nMedvedev's comments are a reversal of Russian position from a lukewarm response following a looser outline for a worldwide currency by Kazakhstani president Nursultan Nazarbayev. On March 11, Nazarbayev suggested the establishment of the \"acmetal\", a portmanteau of \"acme\" and \"capital\", as a reserve currency replacing the ruble in international transactions, first for Central Asia and then worldwide. 1999 Economics Nobel laureate Robert Mundell, speaking to the Daily Telegraph, endorsed the idea, saying \"It would be a very good idea if the G-20 took that idea up in London\". \n2001 Nobel economics prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, meanwhile, said the new currency could come about quickly if it was based on an expansion of the IMF's already established system of Special Drawing Rights, units of exchange used by the IMF which already have some of the features of currency. Stiglitz argued that, as the US dollar has become the standard global reserve currency, it has inadvertently created a system which hurts the world economy. \"It's a net transfer, in a sense, to the United States of foreign aid,\" he argued, reasoning that when other countries purchase US dollars in order to use them on international markets (such as for the buying and selling of petroleum), they effectively give the US a zero-interest loan \u2014 sometimes at times when they can least afford it. Stiglitz made his comments as head of a United Nations panel of economists giving recommendations to address the global financial crisis.\nIn the weeks leading up to the G-20 conference, the People's Republic of China also began discussing a new system for reserve currencies. In a March 23 speech, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, endorsed a new reserve currency, saying \"the desirable goal of reforming the international monetary system, therefore, is to create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run, thus removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit-based national currencies.\" Zhou went on to endorse the expansion of the SDR system in the long-term creation of a reserve currency government by the IMF. While Zhou did not mention the US dollar specifically, analysis by Qu Hongbin, chief China economist for HSBC, for the Financial Times said that the speech \"is a clear sign that China, as the largest holder of US dollar financial assets, is concerned about the potential inflationary risk of the US Federal Reserve printing money\".\nChina holds $740 billion as assets; inflation in the US economy, which has been low in recent years, would directly cause those assets to lose value.\nWhile the Chinese government has engaged in currency swaps with several other growing economies, such as South Korea, Argentina, Malaysia and Indonesia, the Chinese Yuan cannot be used itself as a reserve currency as it cannot be freely traded on the global market.\nThe Chinese-Russian proposal was not entered onto the agenda at the G-20 meeting itself. Nonetheless, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that the G-20 was open to considering the proposal if and when a detailed one is presented. United States President Barack Obama, meanwhile, endorsed the continuation of dollar supremacy, saying that the US dollar is \"extraordinarily strong\" and arguing that its strength was the result of the intrinsic stability of the United States economic and political system; US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner had, the week before, made comments that while he supported an expansion in the SDR mechanism he rejected the idea of a global currency. Rather than change the role of SDRs, the G-20 meeting instead added $250 billion in support to the fund backing SDRs.\nAfter the G-20 conference ended on Thursday, Malaysia's The Star BizWeek reported that the central banks of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand had endorsed the Chinese proposal. All three countries have close economic ties with China and suffered heavily from the collapse of their currencies in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis; the sudden growth in the value of the US dollar relative to those countries' native currencies sharply increased debt in Southeast Asia's economies, leading to a wave of bankruptcies.\nInternational reaction from other economies has been mixed and guarded. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil, said that the currency proposal was important to discuss but did not give extensive comment. And while UPI reports that India supported the SDR proposal at the G-20 conference, the Indian Press Trust quotes Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as saying last month, \"It is too early to talk about common currency.\"\nCalls for an independent global reserve currency are not new. In 1944, John Maynard Keynes proposed the \"bancor\", a unit like the SDR supported by a basket of commodities. Keynes' idea was rejected and the US dollar took the equivalent role under the Bretton Woods system. Keynes proposed that the bancor system would be reinforced by a tax on participating countries' current accounts, the difference between their exports and their imports, in order to encourage balanced trade. Meanwhile, monetary unions have become more popular since the end of the gold standard, with most of the European Union now trading the euro, and several countries outside the EU using it as a de facto currency; five West African countries adopting the eco at the end of this year; and the African Union planning to introduce the afro in 2028. Proposals for a North American currency union based around the  so-called \"amero\" have been frequently discussed as the focus of conspiracy theories in the United States, but none of the US, Canada or Mexico have actively pursued the establishment of any such monetary union, however the dollar is the currency of several Latin American countries.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

In a speech to delegates from across the continent, Mr. Annan, who was born in Ghana, labeled the Darfur crisis as \"one of the worst nightmares in recent history\". But Mr. Bashir said he was concerned that a UN mandate would be seen as a \"western invasion\" that would attract militants and create a situation similar to Iraq.\nKofi Annan said that he hoped dialogue would continue on the issue. The current African Union (AU) force of 7,000 has struggled to maintain order in a country with over 2.5 million displaced citizens. There have also been accusations of rape by AU soldiers inside camps. \nIn his speech, Mr Annan praised the progress in development across the continent since 1997 saying,\"Despite elections, many Governments continue to suppress opposition parties and a free press. Many continue to exclude certain groups from participation in public life. Many continue to practise or tolerate large scale corruption,\" in his last address to the AU. \nAlso in attendance at the summit was Hissene Habre, Chad's leader until 1990. He will face trial in Senegal, according to an announcement made Sunday by the Senegalese president Abdoulaye Wade.\nHabre is accused of human rights abuses during his reign, including 200,000 counts of torture. There has been much wrangling as to who should try the former leader. Belgium initially stepped in to hold the trial, but Mr. Wade agreed with the AU that \"Africans must be judged in Africa.\"\nFormer president Habre ruled Chad for eight years before being removed after an uprising by current president Idriss Deby.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a correction?

The three day summit, which was scheduled to last until the  afternoon of July 3 overran, ending just before midnight.\nThe main issue discussed was the call for the setting  up of a Pan-African government. The Libyan leader, Muamar al-Gaddafi, and the Senegalese President, Abdoulaye Wade, were advocates for its establishment as soon as possible. Gaddafi was in favor of a single African army, foreign policy and government. Others such as Robert Mugabe and Thabo Mbeki were more inclined to a more gradual process of integration. Yoweri Museveni, of Uganda, preferred more economic integration to political union, as he felt Africa  was too diverse to be under one government.\nThe African leaders put out a unanimous declaration agreeing to set up a Ministerial Committee to examine the relationship between an African Union government and the various national governments. The committee would also be expected to look at the impact on the sovereignty of member states and to provide a time frame and road map for the process.\nThe idea of a continental government was first advocated by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana in the mid fifties and sixties when he was the Ghanaian president. It however received very little support at the time.\nThe host of the summit, John Kufuor of Ghana, Chairman of the Union, said there had been no winners or losers and that the debate had been characterised by tolerance and mutual respect. He said Africa's union was not being modelled on that of the USA nor the European Union but rather on model that would be unique to the continent. He was also keen on the rationalization of the various Regional Economic Commissions towards the realization of an African Economic Commission.\nThe next summit is scheduled for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 2008.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Libya in particular had pressed for the decision, with leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, who hosted the summit, going so far as to invite controversial Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to address the summit; the Iranians agreed but later canceled the visit.\nA Human Rights Watch spokesman said \"This resolution, the result of unprecedented bullying by Libya, puts the AU on the side of a dictator accused of mass murder rather than on the side of his victims, but it cannot erase the legal obligations undertaken by the 30 African countries which have ratified the ICC treaty.\"\nThis treaty requires signatory states \u2014 which al-Beshir has avoided since the March issuing of the arrant \u2014 to arrest any suspects within their borders. Sudan's foreign ministry commented that now \"The president is free to travel anywhere in Africa, including those countries that have ratified the ICC's Rome statute.\"\nAmnesty International also criticised the new resolution, with Amnesty Africa's director Erwin van der Borght saying \"This decision by the African Union member states shows a disdain for those in Darfur who suffered gross human rights violation and makes a mockery of the AU as an international body. By supporting a wanted person accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, it undermines the credibility of states which are party to the Rome Statute and the AU as a whole.\"\nThe Sudanese foreign ministry said that \"We think that Africa is now one front against the ICC ... Most Africans believe it is a court that has been set up against Africa and the third world.\"\nSudan's government has estimated 10,000 people have died as a result of violence in Darfur since February 2003, while the United Nations (UN) puts the figures as 300,000 dead with 2.7 million having fled their homes. The UN Security Council was criticised by the AU for its refusal to consider suspending al-Beshir's warrant for one year, which Africa said could have helped efforts seeking peace in Darfur.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

They joined the nearly 1,500 African Union forces from Sudan and Tanzania, with Libya, France, and the United States providing logistical support for the operation.\nThe Comoros government says they have already captured most of the island. \"The operation started in the early morning hours and it is going smoothly and according to plan,\" said Abdourahim Said Bakar, a government spokesman. \"The military has taken control over most of the island - the airport and Anjouan's capital, Mutsamudu.\" \nThere have been no official reports of casualties, but two African Union soldiers appear to have suffered minor injuries, and one reporter saw an elderly man being carried away after apparently being hit by a stray bullet.

After his term expired in 2007, he held his own elections in which he declared himself the winner. This election was viewed as illegal by Comoros and the African Union.\n\"We hope that by the end of the day we will have the problem resolved,\" the government spokesman said. \"A special group has been selected to capture Bacar, arrest him and bring him to court. He has to pay for his crimes.\" \nThe spokesman also outlined his priorities for Anjouan once the island is stabilized, which included holding elections within three months, disarming Bacar's miltias, and putting Bacar on trial for corruption and human rights abuses once he is found.\nThe troops met some resistance from supporters of Mohamed Bacar, armed with assault rifles and rocket launchers and numbering around 400. Some loyalists gathered near Bacar's residence in Barakani, but the military soon took control of the area. The residence was searched, but Bacar was nowhere to be found.\nThe Bacar loyalists have reportedly begun using guerrilla tactics against the invading forces. \"I have over a hundred men and we will fight until we die,\" said Lieutenant Ibrahim Moussa of the loyalists. \"It's God's will that will decide who is to win and who is to die. The invaders won't make it through.\"\n\u2014Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi, President of ComorosThough one Comoros soldier reports that three of Bacar's highest-ranking supporters have been arrested, Bacar himself remains at large.

Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates opened the summit on today, calling it a meeting of equals in a community of nations that shares a historic duty.\nThe Portuguese leader promised a frank and open discussion with no taboos. This was seen as a reference to issues such as conflicts and human rights violations in Africa as well as historical injustices in Euro-African relations.\nThe chairman of the African Union, Ghana's President John Kuofor, said the relationship between Africa and Europe during the past 500 years has been unhappy, characterized by the slave trade, colonialism and apartheid. He said a new relationship is needed to correct what he called a historic inhumanity.\n\"The real significance of the Africa-EU summit must therefore be to lay the foundations of a new partnership based on mutual respect and a genuine commitment to pursue the mutual interests of our two continents,\" he said.\nThe leaders are to establish a new strategic partnership with eight priority areas. These include peace and security, governance and human rights, economic development, environmental degradation, migration and trade.\nThe President of the African Union Commission, Alpha Oumar Konare, said the relationship must avoid charity, paternalism and false promises.\nHe says no one will solve Africa's ills for it. Africa must play the game of globalization but not unilateral globalization based solely on market forces.  Konare said the new partnership must develop ways to address this issue.\nEfforts to hold the Africa-EU summit have been thwarted for the past five years by a dispute over Zimbabwe's human rights record. President Robert Mugabe's invitation this year prompted a boycott by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler.\nHuman rights activists have protested that summit leaders are ignoring suffering and oppression on the continent. And opponents of globalization said the summit's approach to boosting trade would aggravate poverty.\nEuropean leaders have been intent on holding the meeting because of competition for Africa's markets coming from China, India and other emerging nations. \n\nHave an opinion on this story?

And only with the commitment of African leaders and European leaders can we really achieve some progress.\"\nThe leaders agreed to increase efforts to fight deforestation and desertification.\nThe president of the European Union, Portuguese Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, said the summit's plan to deal with migration was an example of the new partnership.  He says the leaders want to combat illegal immigration but encourage legal migration and help immigrants to integrate more fully into their new countries.\nThe leaders agreed to develop information programs for would-be migrants in Africa and to address the drain of African skilled workers by promoting ethical recruitment policies in critical fields.\nOn governance, the head of the African Union, Ghana's President John Kufuor, said Africa has an interest in good governance and respect for human rights.\n\"Transparency is the order of the day,\" he said. \"This is not to saying there is perfection. The point is that we all see that it is with good governance that we will attract the partnerships for development that we need.\"\nHe noted that the AU has created mechanisms such as the Africa Peer Review to promote these ideals.\nThe leaders also agreed to promote security by developing a system for rapid conflict prevention and funds for an African rapid deployment force, but human rights issues brought discord.\nFile:Robert Mugabe.jpg\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe's human rights record as bringing shame on the continent. This led Mr. Mugabe to accuse her of arrogance. A dispute over whether to invite Mr. Mugabe blocked the summit for five years and was only resolved a few months ago.\nSudanese President Omar al-Bashir met with United Nations officials seeking to deploy a joint U.N.-Africa peacekeeping force in Darfur. The two sides said some clarifications were obtained but that critical needs remain, in particular air support.\nThe issue of free trade agreements caused the most public controversy.  Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade said the accords would set back African development.\nHe says there is no African industry that can withstand competition from Europe with its millions of consumers.\nMost African governments have refused to sign the accords. The accords exempt African exports from European tariffs but also call for lower African tariffs on European goods. European officials said negotiations will continue.\nCivic organizations had little praise for the summit.  The Oxfam group said African opposition to the trade agreements should serve as a wake-up call to European leaders.\nHuman Rights Watch said the summit failed to make any progress on restoring the rule of law in Zimbabwe, bringing peace to Darfur or preventing banks from protecting the wealth of corrupt officials.\nAnd Save The Children called the meeting a high profile exercise of little substance, noting that five million African children continue to die of preventable causes every year. It said since the leaders declared this a summit of equals they must bear equal responsibility for its failures.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

They added that more than 50 AU pacificators and military personnel are MIA since the attack on the base, although the figure could not be confirmed as the fighting had not stopped.\nIn what was called \"...the heaviest loss of life and biggest attack on the African Mission,\" by AU spokesperson Noureddine Mezni, 30 vehicles raided the AU base in the town of Haskanita just after the sunset meal which ended the daytime fasting of Ramadan. The base was completely destroyed.\nInsurgents in Darfur have become increasingly disillusioned with the AU peacekeepers, and are convinced that they too often side with the Sudanese government.  Several attacks on AU forces have been blamed on these insurgents.\nThe SLA did not comment on the latest raid of the AU base. However, a leader in the allied Justice and Equality Movement said that they were engaged in combat against government-aligned Janjaweed forces days before. Some sources have said that was orchestrated by JEM rebels in an attempt to gain supplies, recognition, and input in the peace talks scheduled for October 27 in Libya.\nThe Sudanese government did not comment on the attacks, although AU officials said that they witnessed multiple Sudanese helicopters and fighter jets leaving for Haskanita from the Sudanese base in southern Darfur.\nThe attack marks the first time an AU base has been overwhelmed since deployment in June, 2004.  The peacekeeping force has failed to slow the fighting in the region, and do not have the ability to defend themselves from attack. They will soon be merged with the 26,000 strong United Nations force, whose first units will arrive in October.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

We are playing with a powder keg\u201d. This followed disagreement about the role that UN would play in providing a force to help deal with the crisis in Darfur.\nKofi Annan, retiring UN Secretary General, yesterday announced agreement of African, Arab and European leaders to provide a 20,000 force to supplement the 7,000 African Union peacekeepers trying to cope with the situation that had resulted in 240,000 being killed and 2.5 million being displaced during three years of conflict in the western region. \nHowever, Lam Akol, the Sudanese foreign minister, said: \"What we agreed upon in Addis Ababa was the African Union (AU) force assuming full command, while the UN role would be confined to providing technical and logistical assistance to the AU mission.\" No dates had been agreed for the deployment of the UN forces.\nEgeland said that the delay would cause the situation to become infinitely worse and would prevent the ingress of humanitarian aid to the millions affected.\nThe African Union is reported as saying that Birmaza, a northern village, has been attacked by the Sudanese government troops and Janjaweed militia with air support. 70 dead are reported. The Sudan government has denied that it supports the Janjaweed.\nChad Prime Minister Pascal Yoadimnadji says that \u201cmercenaries in the pay of the Sudanese\u201d have invaded towns in northeast Central African Republic.

Multiple different female members of the Scientology group called the Sea Org said they were pressured to have abortions, and were threatened with separation from their families, hard labor, interrogations, and shunning, if they did not comply. \nWomen that came forward to the St. Petersburg Times said that those who did not wish to undergo an abortion were shunned by others within the Sea Org group, and were labeled as \"out ethics\" and \"degraded beings\". The Sea Org consists of 6,000 members of Scientology, who sign billion-year contracts to work for the organization for multiple lifetimes. Joining the Sea Org is considered a high calling within Scientology.\nL. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, stated his appreciation for families within the Sea Org. Scientology's subsequent leader, David Miscavige, issued an order that children were to be banned in the Sea Org. The mandate by Miscavige asserted that children hampered the productivity of the Scientology order.\n\u2014Tommy Davis, Scientology spokesmanScientology representative, Tommy Davis denied all of the assertions made by the women. \"There is no church policy to convince anyone to have an abortion, and the church has never engaged in such activity. The decision to have a child or terminate a pregnancy is a personal decision made by a couple. That applies to all Scientologists. If any current or former Sea Org member ever 'pressured' someone to have an abortion, they did so independently, and that action was not approved, endorsed or advocated by the church,\" stated Davis to the St. Petersburg Times. \nAnother woman is suing the Scientology organization in United States federal court, and stated she was threatened with severe repercussions if she did not have an abortion. Claire Headley, 35, a member of the Sea Org when she was in Scientology, told the St. Petersburg Times, \"The policy was if a staff member became pregnant, that they were to have an abortion.\" \nIn 1991, Headley became a member of the Sea Org at age sixteen, and began work with the division of the organization in Los Angeles, California. She married at age seventeen, while a member of the organization. Headley said that officials within Scientology leadership pressured her to have two abortions: one at age nineteen, and another at age 21. Headley believed she had \"no choice\", as she had witnessed other women that refused to have abortions instructed to perform manual labor, with one pregnant woman ordered to dig ditches. Headley said that during pressure to have her second abortion she was forbidden to phone her husband to discuss the decision. She spent a total of thirteen years in the Sea Org.\n\u2014Claire HeadleyLaura Dieckman, 31, said that she was enthusiastic about beginning a family when she became pregnant within Scientology at age seventeen, but was instructed to have an abortion. In a federal lawsuit against Scientology, Dieckman stated she joined with the Sea Org at the age of twelve, and at age sixteen she married another member of the group, Jesse DeCrescenzo. She said she was pressured to have an abortion in 1996. \nDieckman said to the St. Petersburg Times: \"I was pounded for two days by the top person in my organization ... about how the baby wasn't a baby yet, it was just tissue and it wouldn't matter if I aborted the baby.\" Dieckman left Scientology in 2004. In a video posted to the website of the St. Petersburg Times, Dieckman emotionally recounted how she had immediately regretted going through with the procedure, \"They will do an ultrasound before the procedure so you see the heartbeat. ... I'm lying there ... and I was like, 'No.' But it's too late. I'd already done it.\"\nNatalie Hagemo said that 20 years ago at age nineteen, she was pressured by Scientology officials to have an abortion, but she resisted. Hagemo gave birth to Shelby on August 20, 1990. Hagemo's daughter was recruited into the Sea Org at age 14. Shelby contacted her mother a week later wanting to leave the Sea Org; Hagemo had a difficult time getting Shelby out of the group. It was not until this year that Hagemo told her daughter about experiencing pressure from Scientology officials to have an abortion.\nThe St. Petersburg Times received sworn depositions from additional women including Sunny Pereira, who said they were intimidated into having abortions they did not wish to undergo. \"They put you in this position where you're weighing the lives of all these people you're supposed to be saving against this one little tiny speck of nuisance that's growing inside of you,\" said Pereira. Spokesman Tommy Davis stated the women were accusing Scientology of forced abortions because of choices they now \"appear to regret\".\nIn Nevada, Republican party candidate for the United States Senate, Sharron Angle, was the focus of criticism for her support of a Scientology-associated program. Angle's opponent, incumbent Senator and Senate Majority Leader Democrat Harry Reid, took out a 30-second negative political ad critical of Angle for supporting \"a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners\". The prison program Angle had supported was based on techniques developed by Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard. Angle had previously been the subject of a similar ad in the Republican primary, generated by the campaign of her opponent Sue Lowden. Sharron Angle is pro-life, and The New York Times columnist Ramesh Ponnuru noted her position against abortion helped her win the Republican primary. \"Angle would not have been able to unite populist conservatives and beat the party establishment\u2019s candidate had she been pro-choice,\" noted Ponnuru.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

For example the Catholic Church, Scientology and Islam dislike/sin homosexuals. Why protest Scientology? The Catholic Church, in terms of atrocities, has likely committed more? Even Muslim extremism... Is Scientology really worth more to protest than those religions or any other?\n((WN)) That was protest the crime and cover-up?

(yourself included) Do you personally feel that we anons have revitalized the more \"serious\" efforts of those in the past who have come out with full names - and have probably gotten into problems over this? And do you believe it serves to ease the process for those Scientologists who were already considering leaving?\n((jennam)) I was just wondering if you were aware of the many other abuses of other religions such as The Watchtower organization of Jehovah's Witnesses.. They do things strikingly similar to Scientology with regards to killing and abusing members and disconnection policies - now, I'm in no way in favor of the management of Scientology but it does look a little blind to me when these other so-called religions get off scot-free. Have you heard of any such allegations before? My concern is that while a step forward is good against one religion, there are others out there just biding by without no real exposure essentially letting them get away with their abuses. I was also wondering if you knew if The Profit would ever be released for viewing?\n((themandotcom)) What do you say to those people that say that Anonymous and the similar groups are religious bigots?\n((StevenFruitsmaak)) Isn't it strange that some countries are recognizing Scientology as an official religion while other countries pursue the Church? What would you say to lawmakers in the former country? Perhaps a short three things you need to know about the Church?\n((Kakama)) What do you think of the fact that Anonymous' motivations are not a moral outrage and are in fact based on the desire to destroy something and get laughs, aka lulz? What about the fact that Anonymous regularly uses illegal activity for its purposes (though we have suspended most in this raid) and is often risque and perverted in nature? \n((Neglacio)) How do you feel about the several nicknames given to you, like Wise Beard Man (WBM), and the several slogans accompanying it? And, by the way, what music do you like?\n((planetstar)) There was a bomb (hoax?) threat video on YouTube by an \"elite anonymous\" as he himself called himself. What would be the implications of such an attack? Could this be another plant by Scientology, and could they actually go through with it?\n((Sfan00)) So you would urge Anonymous to report any such threats to the authorities?\n((WN)) Anything you would like to add Mr. Bunker?\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

He announced his candidacy for the 2012 race immediately following the 2008 election. Schriner refers to himself as the \"Average Joe\" candidate, and advocates a pro-life and pro-environmentalist platform. He has been the subject of numerous newspaper articles, and has published public policy papers exploring solutions to American issues.\nWikinews reporter William Saturn\u200e talks with Schriner and discusses his campaign.\n((William Saturn))  I was reading the January 2009 article In the 2008 presidential campaign, it was Joe the Plumber. In 2012, it\u2019s going to be Joe the Painter from the Star Beacon , and it says that you're \"a former print journalist and addictions counselor who switched to house painting when he felt guided to run for president.\" Why did you feel guided to run for president?\n((Joe Schriner)) Ok, \u2018Joe the painter\u2019\u2026 While the Star Beacon article was done quite well as a whole, the wording in this part about \u2018the presidency and house painting\u2019 is a bit too abbreviated, and a bit too disjointed.  The more accurate version is\u2026 I have a degree in journalism from Bowling Green State University and have worked for several intermediate sized newspapers in Ohio. A ways into this, I changed professions and became a licensed chemical dependency counselor who started one of the first outpatient treatment programs in the Midwest for people who were raised in addictive/dysfunctional families.  (As an aside, during Campaign 2000, I told CBS News in Monterey, that: \u201cTo heal the country, we have to heal the family.\u201d [1]  After working in the chemical dependency field for about eight years, I felt a spiritual prompting \u2013 as other people at times feel spiritual promptings to do any number of things \u2013 to leave this profession and go out on the road to look for people trying to make a difference when it came to things like healing the family, saving the environment, helping the poor, creating peace [2]...I felt compelled to gather these stories, using my journalism background, then share them with others \u2013 with the hopes of planting \u201cseeds of change.\u201d  After a long, considered discernment process, I decided to go on the road and left  Cleveland, in 1990.  This was the start of an eight-year research period where I logged close to 100,000 miles.  What I learned was a lot of tremendously creative, common sense solutions to practically all the issues of our day.  Armed with this, I started to running for president in 1999, and have been doing it ever since (four successive election cycles).  In each newspaper interview, each radio show, each speech... I share parts of what I researched with the hopes people will try some of it in their own town, and who knows how far out it will ripple from there.  (I found that running for president is a great way to get a message out.  And yes, I am indeed trying to win as well. Then I could get the information out a lot quicker, and further.) Now as far as the house painting, because I'm on the road some six to eight months a year campaigning, it's logistically quite hard to hold down a counseling or journalism job. So, instead, I do some part-time house painting to make ends meet. And thus, \u201cJoe the painter.\u201d [3]   Note:  As an example, in the heart of Buffalo, I interviewed Dr. Myron Glick who felt his own 'spiritual prompting' to move his family to inner city Buffalo and start the Jericho Road Health Clinic.  He uses a minimal sliding fee scale and has seen people from at least 50 different countries (Buffalo is a port city).  Why?  Because he's Christian, he told me, and it is Jesus Christ' edict that we help the poor.  I have shared Dr. Glick's story all over the country, with the hopes of inspiring other doctors to consider doing some version of the same.  And each time that happens, I get a component of our healthcare bill passed \u2013 and another little kid living below the poverty line gets the medical help they might have otherwise not gotten.  For more on our healthcare position paper, see [4] or, listen to my \u201cFireside Podcast\u201d on healthcare, and podcasts on other pressing issues of the day, at  [5]  \n((WS)) When you announced your candidacy following the 2008 election, you remarked that this would be your final run. Why did you make that decision, and why did you announce your candidacy so early in the electoral process?\n((JS)) Given the strategy about using running for president as a way of getting a message out to help change America now, I always announce early and start hitting the road often just as early.  For instance, I was just on the front page of the LaGrange (GA) News talking about a project we'd researched (the Alterna Project) to provide long-term, affordable housing for new Hispanic immigrants in a community setting.  Now if I had walked in the doors of that newspaper, approached an editor and said:  \u201cHi.  I'm Joe from Cleveland and I have some great ideas I'd like to share with you.\u201d  He/she would have looked at me, not like I was from Cleveland, but rather like I was from, oh, Mars...  Also being on the road early, gives me that much more time to continue my cross country research for our position papers, and such.  [6]  And it gives me more time to, well, campaign in general.  When you're short on Lear Jets and have to travel in a 1984 family camper, it just takes you a bit more time to get around.  \u201cAmerica is a lot bigger than it looks on the map,\u201d I often joke.  And as far as this being our final run... we're planning on winning this time.  [7] Although it just occurred to me that when I win this time, I'll have to run again for a second term. They don't call me \u201caverage Joe\u201d for nothing. (My wife Liz says I\u2019m sometimes a bit short on forward planning.)  For more about Liz [8]. \n((WS)) Back in 2000, Steve Chawkins with Ventura County News, wrote to you \"You won't win, you won't be president.\" Why do you believe you lost that particular election as well as the 2004 and 2008 elections? What have you done differently during this run?\n((JS)) Why I didn't win in 2000, 2004 and 2008?  I didn't get enough votes. (Sorry.) Actually, each election I have been somewhat quietly, and under-the-radar, going about meeting with people on the ground, giving talks, doing local media, putting up fliers...We do all the things the other campaigns do, only with a much smaller budget.  I recently told the Sun News in Lakewood, that this, indeed, is \u201c...a serious attempt by an average citizen to run for president.\u201d  Yet as for the current state of election dynamics in America, we're up against this huge Goliath(s), and our 'sling shot and stone' \u2013 if one allows that metaphor \u2013 will be sparking a grassroots revolution.  But for this to happen, and for this to become a national story with staying power (and not a 15-minutes-of-fame national media blip), people would have to know that there has been tremendous depth and breadth to the research and campaigning. (As just another example, I have traveled more than 80,000  miles campaigning in the past 11 years.  And I might well be the most well traveled presidential candidate (domestic road miles) -- in the history of U.S. politics.)  [9]  So as to what we'll do different in this election?  Not much.  I intend to stick to our \u201cback road to the White House\u201d strategy [10] , continuing to go from town to town \u2013 waiting for that long caravan \u2013 both literally and metaphorically \u2013 to start lining up behind us.   \n((WS)) In some sources it says you are running for the Green Party nomination, while in others it says you are running as an Independent. Let's clear this up, are you running for any particular party's nomination, or as an Independent?\n((JS)) I have primarily run as an independent candidate during these four election cycles.  And I am currently running as an independent candidate now.  However, in 2007 I vied for the presidential nomination with the Green Party. [11]  I didn't get their nomination, yet I continued to run in the 2008 election as an independent candidate.  For campaign 2012, I might vie for the Green Party nomination again, once their Primary process starts.  Or, and this is another possibility, there has been some talk over the years of a \u201cfusion candidacy\u201d among Third Parties.  That is, say, the Constitution Party, the Green Party, the Libertarian Party... would all get behind a single presidential candidate to increase the chances of a Third Party candidate winning.  If this evolves, I would consider vying for that kind of candidacy as well.  Running with a Party increases your chances of getting ballot access exponentially.\n((WS)) How large is your campaign?\n((JS)) In comparison to the size of most major two Party campaigns, I once told a network news show in Indianapolis, in response to a similar question about our size:  \u201cThink the movie Hoosiers.\u201d  This, by the way, played well in Indiana.\nHas your campaign received any notable endorsements?\n((JS)) Bill Samuels, president of the organization Consistent Life, has personally endorsed us in several campaigns.  (Consistent Life embodies valuing the sanctity of life at all stages from the \u201cwomb to the tomb\u201d and is a network uniting organizations and individuals who support a consistent life ethic.  Their issues revolve around improving a spectrum of issues from poverty, to healthcare, to abortion, to global warming... and anything else that has the potential to end life prematurely.)  \u201c[Schriner] is a Christian who is running as a consistent life ethic candidate.  He is right on all the life issues on which Obama is wrong,\u201d Samuel wrote in 2008\u2026    Then there have been the media endorsements.  Some examples:  \u201c...he (Schriner) seems to make a lot more sense than most politicians I try not to listen to.\u201d  Steve Zender, editor, The Progressor-Times newspaper, Carey.  \u201cIsn't our generation ready to truly make our world better?  The first step?  Vote for Joe!\u201d  Leah Beth Bryson, columnist for The Vision student newspaper, Lambuth University.  \u201cA lot of what Joe says really would come across as good, common sense to many Americans.  They would gladly have someone like him leading the country...\u201d  --editor David Green, The Observer, Morenci.  Then there have been all the 'average Joe' endorsements \u2013 'notable' to us \u2013 from around the U.S.  The following are a smattering of excerpts from a few of these comments (which came in e-mails and letters):   \u201cJust wanted you to know that I'm really impressed with all the research on a variety of local initiatives Mr. Schriner has done.  I was looking for a candidate I could actually support, and I found one here.\u201d  --Iowa.  \u201cI had been searching for a candidate with a consistent life ethic, a commitment to actively working for peace and justice, and concern for the environment... I will happily support you at the voting booth today.\u201d \u2013 Washington.  \u201cI was tired of not voting for someone, but rather against the other main candidate.\u201d  --Ohio  \u201cMy conscience will be clear when I leave the voting booth... and I approve of this message.\u201d --Georgia.  And from more short media takes on the campaign\u2026  [12]   \n((WS)) Describe to me an average day in the life of Joe Schriner. How do you spend your time?\n((JS)) When I'm on the road campaigning, my day looks something like this.  (Incidentally, we often move from town to town daily, where versions of this template repeat over, and over, and...).  First, we generally get up early and either go to Mass, or do family prayer.  Then after breakfast (often oatmeal), Liz starts to do homeschooling \u2013 or as we colloquially refer to it: \u201cmotor-home schooling\u201d \u2013 with our three children.  [13]  Meanwhile I'll go, often unannounced, to a local newspaper (radio stations, TV stations...) and inform them about a corner whistle-stop event we'll be doing at noon in their town.  Sometimes they'll have me stay to do an interview right then, other times they'll send a reporter to the event.  Around 10:30 a.m., we'll go to a local library where Liz will continue with the homeschooling and I'll update our campaign website blog about the events of the day before.  [14]  Shortly before noon, we'll arrive at the downtown venue where we'll unfurl banners, flags and go into \u201cstreet corner whistle-stop mode.\u201d  We'll wave and call out to passing motorists, the kids and I will walk about passing out fliers, our young Jonathan will try to get passing truck drivers to honk...  It's all rather festive.  Afterward we do media interviews, [15]  then head out to lunch at Taco Bell, or wherever.  After some Dollar Menu bean burritos, we'll take the kids to a park or local YMCA where we all exercise a bit.  Afterward, a variety of things might happen.  Sometimes we go door-to-door in a town passing out fliers and putting them up in downtown businesses as well.  Other times, there's a brief window of time in the late afternoon, and early evening, to write the speech for an event we're doing later that night.  Other times we'll take the kids to, say, a Little League ballgame early in the evening.  And as they watch the game, I go about passing out campaign literature and talking with folks.  Other evenings, we're meeting with supporters in their homes, or I'm out doing research on one of the projects we've come across, or for that matter, I'm sometimes out throwing the football around with the boys... Then, as the evening starts to wind down, we'll look for somewhere to park \u2013 whether a campground, church parking lot, Wal-Mart parking lot...  And as the kids settle in, we tell \u201cstories from the road,\u201d or read the kids a book, or the kids will draw, write letters, do Lego stuff on their own...  We then say evening prayers together as a family before the kids go to sleep.  And finally, Liz and I will often stay up late playing Scrabble, or talking about the day, or working on the scheduling and itinerary for the next several stops.  Or some nights, after a day of, well, too close quarters with the kids, Liz and I will simply sit and stare out the camper windows, in silence.  Silence that is only occasionally broken by an exhausted Liz, or an exhausted me, repeating the refrain:  \u201cI think we need a staff.\u201d\n((WS)) If you had complete power at this moment, what would you do? How would you change America?\n((JS)) If this means complete power, as opposed to having to deal with the checks and balances built into our federal government, this is some of what I'd do:  I'd end abortion and all the precipitating factors leading to it (poverty, dysfunctional family dynamics, relaxed sexual mores, alcohol and drug addiction...).  I'd mobilize a set of dramatic initiatives to, not just curb global warming, but to actually start to reverse it.  I would unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons.  I'd stop the production of nuclear energy.  (Anybody hear of Chernobyl?)  I would grant amnesty and family reunification to illegal immigrants.  [16]  (During a talk at an immigration rally in Arizona several years ago, I said we walked through the slums of Juarez, where violence is off the charts and many of the children are extremely hungry.  If I was their parent, I'd do everything I could to get these children out of harms way and get them something to eat \u2013 even if it meant risking crossing the border illegally.) I would end the death penalty.  Also in Arizona, I read a newspaper story about a death penalty protester who posed:  \u201cWhy do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?\u201d  Good question.  I would increase, exponentially, American foreign aid (it is currently only 4% of the budget) to try to help stem world hunger much more \u2013 24,000 people starve to death every day in the world \u2013 and to help realize Habitat for Humanity's goal of providing adequate housing, (\u201c\u2026for every person in the world.\u201d)  I would bring peace to urban war zones around the country. [17]   (In part of this effort, our family moved into a dangerous part of Cleveland, Ohio, to be part of the solution.)  I would end homelessness.  (We take homeless people into our home.  And we will be doing the same in the West Wing.  I mean the Lincoln bedroom is free, as an example.)  I would tremendously jack down and simplify the economy, shifting America back to much more of a local production for local consumption orientation, like it was in the \u201cold days.\u201d  I would mobilize efforts for a tremendous come back of the small family farm and the practice of growing organically.  This was once the backbone of our country, I told the newspaper Country Today in Wisconsin.  And it should be again. [18]  I would get people to tighten their belts and pay off the National Debt so our children don't inherit it.  During a talk at the University of Notre Dame recently, I said I would redirect the technical smarts at NASA toward coming up with better water filtration systems, solar panels, wind turbines..., as opposed to working on things like going to space destinations where we: can't breathe the air, there's no gravity and there's no food! \u201cThat might be, oh, a hint God doesn't want us there,\u201d I said.  I would give some of the land back to the Native Americans so it's equitable, like it should have been from the beginning.  [19] And I would give the African Americans tangible reparations for past atrocities and the ongoing trans-generational problems slavery caused.  And, I would ensure \u2013 as impossible as this seems \u2013 that the Cleveland Browns had a winning season, soon...  For a look at how I would actually try to make a lot of this happen, the Cleveland Browns notwithstanding, go to my rather extensive position papers at [20]  \n((WS)) When you say \"we are left of the Green Party,\u201d does that mean you view yourself as a socialist?\n((JS)) No, I'm not a socialist.  In the article you allude to, I made that comment (as I often do) in relationship to being \u201cleft of the Green Party\u201d when it comes to the environment.  And that's hard to do.  If fact, I told the Freemont Messenger newspaper in Ohio that when it comes to helping the environment, no Party even comes close to matching the Green Party.  I have merely used the 'left of the Green Party' thing to illustrate how serious we are about the environment.  During a Third Party presidential candidate debate at the National Press Club in Washington, I said that our family had established a \u201cKyoto Protocol Home Zone.\u201d  We don't use air conditioning, cut the thermostat back in the winter, dry clothes on the line, recycle practically everything, live simply with few material items, bicycle or walk practically everywhere within a five-mile radius of our home, use lights sparingly...  And at the White House, we'd be doing the same. Not to mention, there would be solar panels and a wind turbine on the White House roof.  Our point being that we can't wait for something more tangible than the Copenhagen Accord at this point, but rather the time for each American to voluntarily act on this is: now!  Note:  We have traveled extensively looking at things like a wind turbine installation in Mandan; a geothermal home installation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan ($17 heating bill in: January); a Southwest Sustainability Project for retrofitting homes with insulation and alternative energy... And our administration would attempt to move America away from being the leading 'Society of Consumers' in the world, to be the leading 'Society of Conservers.'  I mean if we're going to lead, why not lead in the right way \u2013 for our kids and for future generations. At the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, I interviewed Winona LaDuke.  Ms. LaDuke is an Ojibwe Tribe member who ran for vice-president with Ralph Nader in Campaign 2000.  She said her tribe believes they are environmentally responsible for the next: seven generations.\n((WS)) As a former addictions counselor, would you like to see some prohibitions on the sale of alcohol? Would you consider yourself a member of the temperance movement?\n((JS)) I would, indeed, be an advocate for temperance (more responsible drinking); but not for a return to prohibition. At the outset, let me draw some parallels to smoking.  It was determined that smoking was hazardous to one's health.  (Currently more than 160,000 people die of lung cancer each year, as an example.)  Then there are other smoking related respiratory issues (like emphysema), and second hand smoke issues, and...  In light of all this, anti-smoking campaigns gained incremental traction over the past 50 years.  These led to eventually getting cigarette smoking ads banned in many media and created a climate favorable for significantly increased taxes on cigarettes.  (President Obama just signed a law increasing federal tax on cigarettes from 32 cents a pack to $1 a pack.) And a wide variety of programs started up to alert youth about the dangers of smoking.  As a result of all this, fewer than 20% of adult Americans still smoke, according to a recent Time Magazine article.  This figure is down significantly from when the campaign started...  Now, while again, I'm not advocating prohibition, common sense says you have to look at the level of drinking in our society at this point \u2013 and how destructive it's becoming.  As a former addictions counselor, I did indeed see the destruction alcohol can wreak.  It lubricates things like domestic violence between spouses, child abuse, broken families...  During our cross country research, I also interviewed Mark West, who started a cutting edge two-year treatment model for recovering alcoholics and addicts in prisons nationwide.  He said 80% of prisoners these days have committed crimes under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or were trying to get money for alcohol or drugs when they committed the crime(s).  Then there are all the alcohol related traffic fatalities and maiming.  Then factor in all those alcoholics who have died of cirrhosis of the liver, or have hemorrhaged to death internally from alcohol addiction, or who have committed suicide under the influence.  And add to all this, the number of people in mental institutions with \u201cwet brains\u201d and other mental health complications from alcoholism.  In essence, the numbers with all this are staggering.  And by comparison, because of the tremendously broad ramifications, alcohol abuse has a much more wide sweeping effect on society than smoking...  So, like with cigarettes, our administration would push for things like a significant jump in taxes on alcohol.  The higher costs, like with cigarettes, will curtail some drinking.  Like with what happened with smoking, we would also push for banning drinking ads in the media (There is currently more money spent on ads for alcohol, than on any other product in America.)  Another strategy that we're looking at is proposing: drinking licenses.  Seriously.  A former bartender in Columbiana County, proposed this to us.  For instance, he said just like with getting a driver's license, there should be a written test for a drinking license.  It would cover such topics as how many drinks it takes approximately to move one's blood alcohol level over the legal limit in a state.  Another set of questions might include identifying the signs and symptoms of alcoholism.  In the event of, say, a DWI, or other criminal offense (robbery, domestic violence...) involving alcohol, a person's drinking license could be revoked for a period of time.  And if he/she was caught drinking during this time, more penalties would be levied.\n((WS)) Your Pro-Life stance seems to be a big issue in your campaign. What are your thoughts on Scott Roeder, who assassinated George Tiller? Was this action justified? How far are you willing to go to end abortion?\n((JS)) I believe abortion is a form of murder.  And I told the Range News in Wilcox, that with abortion American society has \u201cbecome its own worst terrorist.\u201d  During an abortion, a baby is systematically dismembered in the mother's womb, then suctioned out.  I mean, c'mon!  Yet even with all this (some 4,000 abortions a day in America now), I don't condone the George Tiller killing.  Because, well, it's yet another 'killing.'  As I mentioned earlier, I don't believe in the death penalty in any form \u2013 even a pro-life vigilante one.  I give talks all over the country explaining that I believe that if pro-life people really want to end this evil, they need to organize \u2013 much better than they are now \u2013 and take to the streets en mass, day in and day out, the same as what was mobilized in the South to end the evil of Segregation.  (We've reached the 50 million abortion mark since 1973.  That's staggering!)) People should regularly be out with protest signs, not just in front of abortion clinics, but in their neighborhoods.  As we've traveled, our family has protested on neighborhood street corners and in front of abortion clinics in California, Michigan, Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida, North Dakota...  And we'd be doing the same as the First Family, I told the Lewiston Argus newspaper in Montana.)  What's more, the newspapers should be flooded with an avalanche of pro-life letters to the editor.  Legislator offices should be deluged with pro-life letters.  A lot of people in the South didn't want Segregation to end, but they wanted the protests to end even more.  So, eventually, Segregation ended. It could well be the same with abortion.  Note:  As I mentioned earlier, I would also work stridently to help end precipitating factors (poverty, dysfunctional family dynamics, relaxed sexual mores, alcohol and drug addiction...) that lead to many abortions.  As I would work to highlight models for the many crisis pregnancy centers we've researched across the country.  Centers that provide food, shelter, clothing, college scholarship money, day care... for moms (and dads) who want to keep their baby. We\u2019ve researched these centers in Minnesota, Indiana, Rhode Island\u2026 For more on our stance on abortion, see:   [21]  or for a more in-depth paper, see [22]  \n((WS)) What are your thoughts on President Obama?\n((JS)) Mixed.  Given, for instance, my stance on abortion (last answer), I find Mr. Obama's strong backing of abortion extremely troubling.  Conversely, I find his efforts toward scaling back nuclear weapons, cutting down on greenhouse gases, getting more access to healthcare for individuals... as commendable (and in line with the Consistent Life Ethic I espouse).  I would, however, push for much stronger action on each of these fronts.  (Granted President Obama might have as well in some of these categories, but, as has been the case with healthcare, he has been hamstrung to a degree by Congress.)  I do disagree with the president's troop surge strategy in Afghanistan.  I believe this will lead to a situation analogous to what essentially devolved into the 'Iraq quagmire.'  And I believe the stepped up drone attacks in the mountain region between Pakistan and Afghanistan is a mistake, considering all the civilians being killed.  (What we so often refer to as a war's \u201cinevitable collateral damage,\u201d is: children, moms, dads...)  Admittedly however, when it comes to both Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Obama inherited tremendous dilemmas, with no easy solutions.  On the environmental/energy front, I strongly disagree with Mr. Obama's plans for more drilling offshore in the Atlantic, and promoting a new generation of nuclear energy plants...  For more on our energy policy, see: [23]  In regard to personal characteristics, I do admire Mr. Obama's tenacity, which was demonstrated graphically in the last election process and with his relentless pursuit of the healthcare bill. An addendum:  There has been much written about Mr. Obama's oratory skills and negotiating skills.  Yet I believe this has to be weighed in the context of:  Is he saying the right stuff?  Is he negotiating for the right stuff?  In my opinion, not always.\n((WS)) What are your thoughts on the Tea Party movement?\n((JS)) I just recently read a Newsweek article about the Tea Party.  An excerpt that particularly caught my eye was:  The Tea Party rejects the idea that \u201c...a government of brainy people can solve thorny problems through complex legislation.\"  The Tea Party finds its strongest spirit among conservative Republicans.  Yet a powerful current of 'blame both sides' also pulses through the movement.\u201d  Lynne Roberts, a volunteer organizer of a Tea Party gathering in Albany, New York said:  \u201cWe're equally disgusted with Republican and Democrat Congressmen.\u201d  ...The day I was answering this question for this article, I was also interviewed by the Americus (GA) Enterprise newspaper.  I said when you objectively step back from society and take a look\u2014we have a mess.  We have a $13 trillion National Debt and we are mired in a deep recession.  We have just crossed the 50 million abortion threshold.  Global warming looms as a scary doomsday scenario.  Violence and poverty are almost off the charts in many of our big city urban cores.  Our prisons are bursting at the seams.  Children are being shot in schools and abducted from the streets\u2026  And one of the main common denominators in this:  For the last couple decades, we've had 'brainy' presidents who have come out of Yale or Harvard.  So what does this say?  I believe it says that, apparently, the education one receives at Yale or Harvard (while impressive to many), isn't the type of education that equips people to, well, solve many of the societal problems I just mentioned.  I mean if it was... I told the reporter in Georgia that to solve the National Debt problem, for instance, we need a common sense president \u2013 \u201cwith a calculator that works.\u201d  I\u2019m serious.  But it's not just the presidents (Congress people, Wall Street bankers, corporate CEOs...), it's us, the American people.  We have gotten ourselves into this mess.  We're in this global warming crisis, as an example, not because the politicians failed to come up with tangible measures at carbon dioxide reduction in Copenhagen; but rather because many of us are failing here.  We drive too much, use too much air conditioning, heat too much, buy too much (it takes the burning of fossil fuels to make the products)...  We're a society addicted to comfort and immediate gratification.  And what's more, just like an alcoholic, we don't want our politicians confronting us about it.  So we elect people who don't confront us \u2013 and the dysfunction (read: destruction) continues.  For a candid look at what we propose for global warming, see: [24] and  [25]  \n((WS)) Which historical figure do you most identify with and why?\n((JS)) George Plimpton.  He was a rather famous sports journalist who was known for 'walking a mile in an athlete's shoes.'  For instance, he spent a spring training practicing with the Detroit Lions and even played quarterback for several downs during an exhibition game.  He then went on to write the book: Paper Lion from the experience.  And that's how I've been, to a degree, as a presidential candidate.  That is, I try to live the platform I espouse.  For instance, as part of our urban platform, we exhort some people in suburban and small town America to roll up their sleeves and move into the urban cores of LA, Chicago, Minneapolis... to work on systemically changing things.(Just throwing more money and police presence at the problem is like metaphorically putting a band aid on something that needs major surgery.)  Taking our own advice \u2013 in a very 'Plimpton-like' manner \u2013 our family moved from Bluffton (pop. 3,857 and think Mayberry) to a hardscrabble part of Cleveland (the poorest big city in the country).  We moved into a block where a group of Catholic Workers were living every 3rd or 4th house down from each other.  There we all helped transform an old asphalt parking lot into an urban farm, volunteered at a drop-in center for the marginalized up the street; coached Rec. Center soccer and baseball teams (many of the kids not having dads at home) [26]  and [27] ...  Besides participating in the transformation of this area, like George Plimpton again, I wrote a book about the experience titled America's Best Urban Neighborhood...[28]  We also, as another example, promote an agricultural platform that would push for the return of the small family farm, en mass. And as we traveled the country, not only did we research the various dynamics of the family farm, but our family worked on a number of them as well.  This included chores like chopping wood, bailing hay, weeding by hoe in an organic bean field\u2026  And these were not 20-minute photo-ops, so to speak.  These were long, sweaty days out on the farm.  The essence of my candidacy has been \u2018being on the ground\u2019 and working side-by-side with ordinary folks, listening to their thoughts, translating them into positions\u2026  Ours, truly, is an \u2018American peoples\u2019 platform.\u2019  Note: While not a bona-fide historical figure (more fiction, but you wish he was real), I also identify with: Rocky.  [29]  \u201cSome may feel it\u2019s another Rocky Balboa story about an Ohio man against the millionaires.\u201d  -- Alban Mehling, Associated Content\n((WS)) Could you take this test, and let us know where you stand on the political spectrum?\n((JS)) On the test, I scored as a \u201ccentrist.\u201d  (Surprised me too.)  \n((WS)) Anything else you want to add?\n((JS)) Anything else I want to add\u2026  My wife Liz and I are running for president as \u201cconcerned parents from the Midwest.\u201d  What we\u2019re concerned about is the alarming increase in climate change, the scary levels of nuclear proliferation (including in this country, even with the new treaty with Russia), mounting violence in our inner cities and stark abject poverty in the Third World.  Then there\u2019s astronomical national debt, 4,000 babies being killed in their mothers\u2019 wombs here each day, endless war, terrorism\u2026  During Campaign 2004, I told a newspaper reporter in La Cross, that I didn\u2019t want to be sitting on my death bed someday, staring our children in the eye and saying:  \u201cI knew all this stuff was going on, but I was too busy making money.\u201d  So our family gave up our normal lives and took to the roads of America to look for solutions to these dilemmas.  And we found them, in the most unlikely of places at that.  We found how to balance the National Budget in tiny Atwood (pop. 1,500).  We found how to stop abortion in Portland.  We found how to end nuclear proliferation in Luck.  We found how to stop terrorism in w:Comers, Georgia. And we found how to realign most of the rest of America in Bluffton (pop. 3,857), \u2018America\u2019s best town.\u2019 [30]  and [31]  And as these were the most unlikely of places, the people behind the projects were often the most unlikely of people.  That is, they were often common sense people with the common good in mind.  Not profit.  Not fame.  Just the common good.  We\u2019ve done, maybe, more than 1,000 interviews with these types of people.  And from these interviews, as I mentioned before, we\u2019ve developed a solid platform.  The best platform out there for where the country needs to go at this point, we believe.  You see, in the face of all the pressing problems I describe at the outset of this particular answer, a lot of the current policies seem to me to be \u201crearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.\u201d  What we need is leadership at this point that can steer the boat away from the iceberg altogether, and quick.  (That is, ironically enough, if there\u2019s going to be any iceberg\u2019s left in the wake of global warming.)  Our common sense platform does that, in spades.  So Americans have a choice this next election.  They can go with yet another Ivy League type choice, contemplating the refrain:  \u201cIf you always do what you\u2019ve always done, you\u2019ll always get what you\u2019ve always got.\u201d  Or they can go with this quite \u201caverage\u201d family from Cleveland, who will bring good old fashion common sense (think Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) to a White House that will look, oh, a bit different\u2014including perhaps even the color.  I mean knowing my wife (soon to be First Lady), she\u2019ll have me painting stuff there on the weekends.  I\u2019m thinking about going with, like, a soft green on the outside. [32]  --Joe  P.S. Don\u2019t let the occasional humor fool you.  This is, indeed, a very serious attempt by an average citizen to run for president.  And wouldn\u2019t it be refreshing if someone like me won?\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

However, recently, some \"third party\" candidates have begun to gain notoriety, namely Libertarian Party nominee Bob Barr and independent Ralph Nader. \nUnbeknownst to many, there are several other minor party candidates in the race. One of them is New American Independent Party nominee Frank McEnulty. McEnulty has been interviewed several times by Wikinews over the past few months, but in one held earlier this week with reporter Joseph Ford, he went into detail on why he'd be a good president, why its necessary to support a third party candidate this year, and most importantly, why you should give him your vote.\nThe interview can be read below.\nWikinews (Joseph Ford): Why are you running for president?\nJoseph Ford: You're the nominee of the New American Independent Party. What does your party stand for? \nJoseph Ford: If elected, how would you handle America's economical crisis? \nJoseph Ford: How would you handle illegal immigration? \nJoseph Ford: How would you handle foreign relations with Europe, where there are growing anti-American feelings? \nJoseph Ford: How would you handle the War on Drugs? \nJoseph Ford: It has been over five years since the Iraq War began. As president, how would you handle it? \nJoseph Ford: For millions of Americans, health care is a major issue. How would you handle it? \nJoseph Ford: Homosexual marriage is an extremely controversial subject among Americans. How would you handle it? \nJoseph Ford: How would you handle America's educational system? \nJoseph Ford: How would you handle abortion? \nJoseph Ford: How would you handle the environment? \nJoseph Ford: Why is it necessary that a third party candidate be voted into the White House this year? \nJoseph Ford: We haven't seen many Frank McEnulty media appearances, billboards or commercials. Will we see these in the weeks ahead? Or are you trying to run more of a grassroots campaign? \nJoseph Ford: How are you currently doing in the polls?\nJoseph Ford: Why are you a better candidate than Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party), Bob Barr (Libertarian Party), John McCain (Republican Party), Cynthia McKinney (Green Party) or Barack Obama (Democratic Party)? Why should the American people give you their vote? \n\nJoseph Ford: There are thousands reading this right now.

The 5-4 vote reflected the change in vote count resulting from the retirement of Justice O'Connor and the confirmation of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito.\nThe Intact dilation and extraction procedure, also known as partial birth abortion, involves removing an intact late-term fetus from the womb via the cervix. While it is a relatively rare operation - 0.17% of all abortions in the US in 2000, it has become a focal point in the abortion debate.\nThe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act bans the procedure in cases where the fetus is terminated during the operation, unless it is performed to to save the life of the mother.\nJustice Kennedy wrote in the opinion of the court: \"respondents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases.\" Further, he said, \"Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception. For these reasons the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits are reversed.\"\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Thomas stated that he joins \"the Court\u2019s opinion because it accurately applies current jurisprudence, including Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992).\"\nIn dissent Judge Ginsburg wrote: \"Today\u2019s decision is alarming. It refuses to take Casey and Stenberg seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\"\nJustice Kennedy's words also recall the complicated issues of standing related to such cases. An issue in Roe v. Wade was the impossibility of any individual having standing in a court proceeding regarding abortion rights, since court proceedings take more than the 9 months of pregnancy, retiring any individual plaintiff's standing before an appeals process can take place. The criterion of \"a large fraction of relevant cases\" may effectively deny standing to any plaintiffs who wish to litigate particular restrictions in some relevant future cases.\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGot a correction?

Its official publication date is July 25th. Intended as a response to Hillary Clinton's book \"It Takes a Village\", certain passages of the book have already caused concern in certain circles. Also in the book, Santorum compares abortion to slavery, and advocates against public school systems and two income families.\nAlready facing perhaps the toughest re-election bid in the country, opponents and supporters of Santorum are using the book to tout their positions. T.J. Rooney, the state Democratic Party chairman, had this to say:\n\"References to how families are compromised when both parents work outside the home, how it takes a societal toll on Pennsylvania families or American families, it just shows a complete lack of understanding of the real world in which the vast majority of Pennsylvanians reside.\"Although he's a Democrat himself, journalist Jules Siegel disagrees with Rooney, \"From what I read in the July 10 AP story about Sen. Santorum's encounter with Hillary Clinton, I believe that he and I share common views on some aspects of child-rearing. Democrats can't handle  motherhood issues because NOW-style feminists will not allow an honest discussion of what to do about the economic consequences of motherhood. Daycare is not the answer. I'm eager to see what Santorum says about right to life after birth.\"\nHillary Clinton's office refused to comment on the book. \nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic domain\nPublic domain\nfalse\nfalse\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

Komen's policy disqualified Planned Parenthood due to a pending investigation on how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money that is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns. Stearns is investigating whether taxes are used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood in his role as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which is under the umbrella of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\"While it is regrettable when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such as a longstanding partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most fully advance our mission,\" Aun said.\nCecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, said, \"While this is deeply disturbing and disappointing, we want to assure women who rely on Planned Parenthood for breast care that we're still here for them, and we always will be.

Previously, it would not support any organization under investigation of any kind; now it says it will only cut support if the investigation involved is \"criminal and conclusive\".

They were not.\"\nPlanned Parenthood said in response to the restoration of Komen's funding, it was \"enormously grateful\".\nSince the cuts were announced, Planned Parenthood gained $3 million (\u20ac2.3m, \u00a31.9m) in donations and 10,000 new Facebook likes. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg personally pledged $250,000 (\u20ac190k, \u00a3158k). 26 US Senators signed a public letter to the charity; in it they said, \"It would be tragic if any woman \u2014 let alone thousands of women \u2014 lost access to these potentially lifesaving screenings because of a politically motivated attack.\" \n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Spokesman for Kenyan police Eric Kiraithe said that \"[i]t is very, very much too early to say who is responsible.

{"title": "Shrink-wrapped sheep survive: Researchers say 'Biobag' artificial uterus, successful on lambs, may one day be suitable for use on premature human babies - Wikinews, the free news source", "date": "Friday, April 28, 2017", "tags": ["Published", "Archived", "Science and technology", "Abortion", "Health", "Philadelphia", "Pennsylvania", "United States", "Oklahoma", "North America", "Pages with template loops", "Pages with defaulting non-local links", "Articles not disputed"], "text": "\u00a0\nIn findings published Tuesday in Nature Communications, a team mostly from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia announced they have successfully created an artificial womb in which premature lambs can be brought to term.  The researchers say this technology could develop into a means of helping premature human babies survive, but it has also drawn concern from bioethicists.\nAccording to first author Emily Partridge and her team, previous efforts at creating an artificial womb have failed because the pumps used, to provide oxygen and nutrients to the developing animal, put too much stress on the heart, causing circulatory failure; and because they used open-fluid systems, which were easily exposed to germs.  Partridge et al.'s system uses a closed-fluid apparatus, which they've called the Biobag. The sound of a maternal heartbeat was played in the room where the fetuses were kept.\nThe animals housed in the artificial womb showed normal blood gases and their lungs, brains and nervous systems showed normal development.  They opened their eyes and grew wool. When they were removed from the circuit and dissected, their brains, lungs and other organs were found similar to those of lambs delivered by hysterotomy (Cesarean section) when nearly full term.\nAlthough lambs often serve as an experimental model of fetal development, the researchers concede that not all of their findings can be translated to humans.  While the lambs' brains appeared healthy, they also develop certain traits much earlier than human brains, so not all of these effects may be attributable to the Biobag system.\nThe researchers also acknowledge the startling appearance of a fetus wrapped in plastic. \"It is important to consider that the comparator is the extreme premature infant on a ventilator and in an incubator,\" reads the official paper. \"We feel that parents will be relatively reassured that their fetus is being maintained in a relatively protective and physiologic environment.\"\nOne of the researchers, Dr. Alan Flake, also of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, says the apparatus may be ready for testing on human babies in three to five years. The researchers noted premature birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, with about nine out of ten infants born at 23 weeks gestation or earlier suffering complications such as mental retardation, deafness, blindness, paralysis, and cerebral palsy.  When a fetus is removed from the amniotic fluid and placed on a respirator, the shift from liquid to gas can cause the lungs to stop developing. The most common direct cause of death among premature infants is failure of the lungs to properly oxygenate the blood.\nBioethicist Dena Davis of Lehigh University notes this invention raises several ethical issues. \"If it's a difference between a baby dying rather peacefully and a baby dying under conditions of great stress and discomfort then, no, I don't think it's better,\" she told National Public Radio.  She also notes the problem of babies who would otherwise have died surviving with severe side effects and the implications that this has for the abortion debate: \"Up to now, we've been either born or not born. This would be halfway born, or something like that.\" Scott Gelfand of Oklahoma State University worries that women who would otherwise seek abortion could be pressured into putting their fetuses in Biobags instead or that employers would punish mothers who took maternity leave instead of using an artificial uterus.\n\"I want to make this very clear: We have no intention and we've never had any intention with this technology of extending the limits of viability further back,\" Dr. Flake said in response to these issues. \"I think when you do that you open a whole new can of worms.\" He went on to call gestating fetuses younger than 23 weeks \"a pipe dream at this point.\"\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Senator Xenophon, an independent politician from South Australia, also requested that police and the Australian parliament investigate whether or not Scientology should retain its tax-exempt status within the country.\nSenator Xenophon tabled letters written to him from former members of the Church of Scientology, which asserted the organization had participated in coerced abortion, abuse, embezzlement, false imprisonment, and hiding information about the deaths of its members.\n\u2014Senator Nick Xenophon\"Scientology is not a religious organisation. It is a criminal organisation that hides behind its so-called religious beliefs,\" said Senator Xenophon in his speech to the Australian Senate. He detailed statements made in the letters he received from former Scientologists that included a father who said he was pressured by Scientology executives to cover up the deaths of his two daughters, and a man who said he had participated in mandating that pregnant female members of the organization have abortions. \n\"These victims of Scientology claim it is an abusive manipulative and violent organization,\" said the Senator. In his speech, he noted that the St. Petersburg Times newspaper of Florida reported on former executives within Scientology who had spoken out critically about the organization. These former Scientology executives said they had been subjected to physical abuse by the organization's leader, David Miscavige. They detailed attempts by the organization to manipulate staff members and perform intelligence operations intended to safeguard the organization's secrets.\n\u2014Scientology representative Virginia StewartIn a statement, the Church of Scientology called Senator Xenophon's speech an \"outrageous abuse\" of parliamentary privilege. Scientology representative Virginia Stewart questioned why the former Scientologists had not contacted the organization itself, \"If these people had key issues, then how come they haven\u2019t contacted the church officially? ... I think it's a bit disingenuous that someone stands up in parliament, where they can say whatever they want.\"\n\u2014Australia prime minister Kevin RuddKevin Rudd, the prime minister of Australia, commented that Senator Xenophon brought up \"grave allegations\" against Scientology. The prime minister stated, \"I share some of those concerns but let us proceed carefully and look carefully at the material which he has provided before we make a decision on further parliamentary action.\" Prime minister Rudd acknowledged, \"many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology\".\nScience fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology in 1953, and its activities have been the source of controversy in Australia for years. Until 1973, the organization was banned in Western Australia and Victoria. In 1983, a High Court ruling acknowledged its religious status.\nOn October 27, the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud by a court in France. On October 24, it was revealed that Academy Award-winning film director Paul Haggis had left the organization after a letter he wrote to Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis was made public. Scientology is currently under investigation in Belgium.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The forum was co-hosted by Glamour magazine. \nClinton led the panel; Fluke and Quinn were joined by additional panelists including the communications chief to former President George W. Bush, Nicolle Wallace; Abby Huntsman Livingston, daughter of former Republican presidential candidate and past governor of Utah and United States Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman; the President of EMILY's List, Stephanie Schriock; and news anchor Amy Holmes.\n\u2014Sandra FlukeFluke remarked upon the slew of media reactions to her February 23 U.S. Congressional testimony about women's health and contraception,  \"One of the things I was really concerned about when ... verbal attacks began was what kind of message this was going to send to young women... I was worried they would think, 'I should sit down and shut up, because if I speak out, this is what happens' ... I want women to see this as an empowering moment.\"\nWallace commented that women should be inspired to work in government due to a motivation of public service, \"If you were asked, 'Will you serve?' you'd say, 'Of course!'... Part of the problem is that our politics are so sick \u2014 there's very little young women see in our news about the essence of what the office once was, which is, public service.\" She noted the potential impact of women voters on the upcoming 2012 U.S. presidential election, \"Women don't vote in a bloc, but they are the largest percentage of independent voters\".\n\u2014Chelsea ClintonClinton pointed out that the United States is joined by the country of Turkmenistan for 78th place in a ranking of the proportion of female members of the federal government. She noted, \"Until my mother ran for president, I wasn\u2019t fully cognizant of how few women run for office and how few women hold office\". \nQuinn informed the panel that when she initially decided to attempt to become Speaker of the New York City Council, critics told her why she would fail, \n\"Because I was from the west side of Manhattan, cause I was too liberal, because I was a woman, because I was a lesbian, all things I knew when I woke up that morning, you know what I\u2019m saying.\" She asserted that politics in New York need not be tied to a particular politician's sex, and stated, \"the sky is the limit in New York.\"\nSchriock emphasized there are indeed women placed in federal elections in the U.S., \"They're running for office right now in 2012. We have a historic number of women running for the United States Senate\". She posed the question of how to ensure these candidates succeed in their elections.\nWallace admitted that she authored novels It's Classified and Eighteen Acres as a cathartic form of expressing herself after viewing the pressures Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Obama experienced in the media during the 2008 campaign cycle. \"I was so scarred by 2008 I made up an imaginary world\".\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

She was called a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" by talk radio show host Rush Limbaugh. In response to these attacks, Fluke has received public support from women, members of the media, and politicians including the President of the United States.\n\u2014Sandra FlukeIn her piece for CNN, Fluke took the opportunity to thank her supporters, writing, \u201cBy now, many have heard the stories I wanted to share thanks to the congressional leaders and members of the media who have supported me and millions of women in speaking out.\u201d She characterized the \u201copponents of reproductive health access\u201d who issued personal attacks against her as being motivated by an attempt to change the topic of conversation away from a dialogue about women\u2019s health, and \u201cto silence women's voices regarding their own health care.\u201d\nFluke wrote that the efforts by some to drown out women from speaking out about women\u2019s health were unsuccessful. She came to this conclusion due to the multitude of positive comments and encouragement sent to her by both female and male individuals urging that contraception medication be considered a medical necessity.\nAsserting that she would not remain silent on this issue of women\u2019s health, Fluke wrote, \u201cAttacking me and women who use contraception by calling us prostitutes and worse cannot silence us.\u201d\nShe noted that a significant majority of women have utilized contraception medication, and commented that there exists a social disconnect between politicians attempting to make it more difficult for women to access this type of health care, and the views of society-at-large about the matter: \u201cRestricting access to such a basic health care service, which 99% of sexually experienced American women have used and 62% of American women are using right now, is out of touch with public sentiment.\u201d\nFluke concluded her piece by emphasizing that those in power should not govern based on ideology: \u201cI am proud to stand with the millions of women and men who recognize that our government should legislate according to the reality of our lives -- not for ideology.\u201d\nAfter being banned by Congressman Darrell Issa from speaking before a Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on February 16 which consisted mainly of male panelists, Fluke appeared before a meeting of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee convened by Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi on February 23.\nFluke spoke to the committee about the need for contraception to be covered by health care plans offered by employers, as a matter integral to women\u2019s health. She cited multiple cases where women take contraception medication as part of their health care for treatment of medical conditions unrelated to birth control, including two women who suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome, a woman who is afflicted with endometriosis and another who takes contraception in order to prevent seizures.\n\u2014U.S. Senator Jeanne ShaheenSpeaking before the United States Senate on February 17 along with fellow members Patty Murray, Kirsten Gillibrand, Barbara Boxer, and Charles Schumer, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire expressed her support for Fluke. Like Fluke, Senator Shaheen pointed out the need not to silence the voices of women in the public government debate about women\u2019s health care: \u201cTime and time again, women have been silenced in this discussion, a discussion about our own very personal health care decisions.\u201d Senator Shaheen concluded her remarks with an explanation as to why she believes women should have significant representation in discussions about their health care: \u201cWomen deserve a voice in this debate because, after all, in the end this is about our health and it is about a health care decision that is between women, their families, their doctors, and their own faith.\u201d\nPresident Barack Obama called Fluke on March 2 to express his support for her courage to speak out on issues of women\u2019s health. In his first press conference of 2012 on March 6, he discussed his reasons for deciding to call Fluke. \nThe President cited his personal thoughts about his own two daughters: \u201cAnd the reason I called Ms. Fluke is because I thought about Malia and Sasha [Obama's daughters], and one of the things I want them to do as they get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree with them on. I want them to be able to speak their mind in a civil and thoughtful way. And I don't want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good citizens.\u201d\nPresident Obama went on to state that Fluke served as a positive role model for citizen participation in democracy and society: \u201cAnd I wanted Sandra to know that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and there's a way to do it that doesn't involve you being demeaned and insulted, particularly when you\u2019re a private citizen.\u201d\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The U.S. Senator from Kansas and Presidential candidate is a Republican whose politics\u2014he is against marriage for gay people, he is against abortion, and he has a clean image in a party tainted by scandal\u2014should speak favorably to the party's base.  But it has not.  \"I'm baffled by that myself,\" Senator Brownback told Wikinews reporter David Shankbone.  \"We haven't been able to raise money.\"  \nA recent poll in Iowa has put him in eighth place, with 2% supporting his campaign.  \"If we don't finish fourth or better in Iowa...we'll pull out.\"  \nSenator Brownback's relationship with God infuses almost every answer you find below.  Although he doesn't feel \"competent\" to explain why God would dislike gays, he does feel strongly that allowing two men or two women to enter into the union of marriage will destroy it for heterosexuals.  Pointing to the research of Stanley Kurtz at the Hoover Institution, Brownback asserts that Northern Europeans have \"taken the sacredness out of the institution.\" \nIn the interview, Senator Brownback discusses the tug-and-pull that befalls him when his constituents show up at his office and say, \"Look, I'm a conservative, but we need this bridge, we need this subsidy, we need this hospital.\u201d  Brownback feels this spending system needs to be changed; however, when it comes to energy policy, Brownback is there for his constituents.  David Shankbone asked the Kansas Senator, a supporter of cellulosic ethanol, why he doesn't support the lowering of tariffs on sugar since sugar ethanol delivers 8 times the energy output of cellulosic ethanol.  Brazil, in particular, has become energy independent because of its sugar ethanol program.  It's cheaper to produce, and there is vastly more bang for the buck in sugar fuel than in corn fuel; an entire country no longer needs to import oil because of it.  Federal tariffs currently make sugar ethanol too expensive in the United States.  \"You're going to kill the ethanol industry here just as it gets going,\" was Senator Brownback's response.  However, there is a debate over whether the process to make corn ethanol uses more energy than the ethanol itself produces.  \nBelow is David Shankbone's interview with Senator Sam Brownback.\nDavid Shankbone:  Senator Brownback, how are you?\nDS: I read that.\nDS: Is it pretty gratifying for you to work with people on the other side of the aisle to try and find solutions?\nDS:  I remember sort of the old days where you'd hear about Ted Kennedy being best friends with Orrin Hatch; do you think that the Tom DeLay period ushered in an era where people were too opposed to each other on the sides of the aisle?\nDS: Running for President has to be a grueling experience, and there must be a million things that you see out there when you're on the road that either you had not thought about before or you didn't know existed.  Could you tell me about one?\nDS:  That's great.  Throughout my life, my father, who is an avid lifelong Republican, he used to tell me--this is a question that I'd asked Tom Tancredo as well, but I think it really comes down to one of the central issues in this race--he had said, \"All we need is a Republican Congress, a Republican Senate, and a Republican White House to get the country on the right track.\"  And last year, he expressed to me that he was very disappointed with where things have gone with the Republicans running things.  He feels let down; he feels like he was lied to by the Party, either through the rationale for the Iraq war, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as Alan Greenspan said, the fiscal irresponsibility.  He feels like there have been many broken promises.  Why should someone like my father vote Republican today?  And I can assure you he will.  But why do you think he should?\nDS:  When you think about dropping out of the race, what emotions do you feel?\nDS:  You've discussed it, and I'm just wondering when it's a thought that occurs to you-- not an inevitability---just when you think about it as a possibility, how do you feel when you reflect upon it?\nDS:  Do you feel sad when you think about possibly leaving?\nDS:  Evangelical candidates haven't fared particularly well in this primary season.  What do you think is the reason for that?\nDS:  The Democrats often have concerns about the electability of their candidates; Hillary Clinton, for example. Do you think that it might scare some people that in this point in time that Evangelicals aren't particularly electable?\nDS:  Do you think Mitt Romney's Mormonism is an issue that people should take into consideration?\nDS:  What if someone was a Zoroastrian?\nDS:  Or a Satanist.\nDS:  Really?\nDS:  Even though religious beliefs are so fundamental to a person?  It's more of a policy issue than it is a faith issue?\nDS:  If someone told you that they were scared to vote for someone who doesn't believe in evolution, what would you say to that person?\nDS:  You don\u2019t think that evolution is incompatible with an intelligent design theory?  That we could have evolved based upon the evolution idea, but that it could have still been the work of God?\nDS:  What's your personal belief on that?\nDS:  It works.\nDS:  What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?\nDS:  What is the culture of life?  How would you describe that phrase?\nDS:  Bobby Schindler, Terry Schiavo's brother, endorsed your candidacy by saying that \"Sam Brownback is the pro-life conservative we can trust to stand for all life, regardless of political calculations.\"  Do you think the death penalty detracts from the culture of life?\nDS:  A common question I've asked in my interviews is about the Iraq War and how it has affected someone as a person.  People often proffer their opinion on the war, but they don't really talk much about how it has affected them personally, perhaps in their world view.  The writer Gay Talese insisted the war has not affected him at all. \"I wish it had,\" he said.  Talese thinks there's a problem with Americans not sacrificing enough, and he argued that we need conscription.  Do you think we need conscription, if not to support the manpower of the war, to make Americans more involved with the wars that we are fighting?\nDS:  What you think the proper role of Congress is in a time of war?\nDS:  Do you feel the American people were misled with the war in Iraq?\nDS:  What do you think is going to happen to Egypt after Mubarak?\nDS:  Do you think it's a bad idea to have elections in countries if it's possible that an Islamic extremist group will win, such as happened in Palestine with Hamas?\nDS:  Do you think that things like the Bridge to Nowhere are projects that shouldn't be funded?  And I'm using that popular phrase--I realize it's a little emotionally charged--but things such as that.\nDS:  You support the Elon plan that would essentially allow Israel to keep the entire West Bank while taking little responsibility for its Arab residents.  The plan is against U.S., Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian policies.  Why do you think that would advance peace in the Middle East?\nDS:  I interviewed the writer Augusten Burroughs.  I would like you to answer a question that he posed.  He said that \"God does not care that the person I watch TV with also has hairy arms, that the idea that a God would not like homosexuals is patently absurd, that it doesn't even begin to become logical in any way, that the idea that the architect of gravity, the being that created the ability for elemental particles that are absolutely nothing to come together and create living organisms and bricks and buildings and cars and jets, that the architect of absolutely everything would care about the sex of the person that this little human loves seems ridiculous.\"  Why is that not ridiculous?\nDS:  Why do you think it would bother God that somebody is gay?\nDS:  In what country that has passed same-sex marriage has traditional marriage declined?\nDS:  Got you.\nDS:  Why did you vote against the Federal expansion of hate crimes to include sexual orientation?\nDS:  Ministers speaking out against homosexuality would come under the province of a hate crime?\nDS:  If you could choose your manner of death, how would you die?\nDS:  It's a Marcel Proust question.\nDS:  But you've never thought about how--if you could choose how you'd prefer to die?\nDS:  It seems like such a basic human thing to contemplate, one's mortality.  I mean, I believe you, but--\nDS:  What weren't you happy with?\nDS:  That was your--\nDS:  Was that your impetus to run for the Senate?\nDS:  What trait do you deplore in other people?\nDS:  Oh...\nDS:  Do you believe that a good Christian should also be a good environmentalist?\nDS:  How so?\nDS:  And you don\u2019t think that Arctic drilling contradicts that notion?\nDS:  What about sugar ethanol?\nDS:  Do you think we should lower tariffs on sugar in order to be able to import more Brazilian sugar ethanol?\nDS:  But it would reduce our dependency on foreign oil, thus increasing our national security, wouldn't it?  Or is the ethanol industry here more important?\nDS:  But the energy that you derive from that is so much less than it is in sugar ethanol.\nDS:  Senator, do you think that Wikipedia is important?\nDS:  Definitely.  What do you find important about it?\nDS:  I tried to get an interview with David Miscavige of the Church of Scientology, and I spoke to their Director of Public Relations; I had about a twenty-minute phone call with him, and he was very hostile to it.  One of the things that I'd said to him--because he was saying that a lot of information is incorrect--I made the point to him that, \"You know, it may be incorrect, but the idea is that you can have Scientologists go on there to correct it.\"  It's not a one-sided place for information; if you feel that there's inaccuracies, the idea is that you can also have people who know the truth go on there and correct it and debate about it, if that is what is necessary to get an accurate view.  Whereas if you say something to Newsweek, and they print something that's incorrect, you're stuck.\nDS:  Very good to talk to you.  Best of luck, Senator Brownback.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

A free vote is due to be conducted on this issue.\nThe first speakers have been all women speaking in support of passing control from the Health Minister to the TGA: Australian National Party Senator Fiona Nash, Australian Democrats Senator Lyn Allison, Australian Labor Party Senator Claire Moore. They have drawn attention to the fact that abortion is already legal in Australia, the inappropriateness of a Parliament minister to regulate a single drug versus a scientific and independent body, and if RU486 is an unsafe drug then the TGA will not approve the drug. Petitions were presented by Moore with the undersigned stating \"medical experts, not the health minister\" should regulate the drug.\nAustralian Liberal Party Senator Gary Humphries then spoke, stating that the bill is a \"mistake\", not because of the possible risks, or that the TGA is unfit to perform the evaluation, but because RU486 is \"not just another drug\", \"facilitating a medical procedure that is not just a medical procedure\". Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle spoke in favour of the bill, making mention of views of others on the supposed push polling of some groups opposing the bill. Liberal Senator Nick Minchin, the new Leader of the Government in the Senate, spoke in support of Humphries and his views, and \"was not persuaded to support [the] bill\", and expressed his \"conservative\" views that life begun \"from conception onwards\". Family First Party Senator Steven Fielding spoke out against the bill also, likening the TGA as comprising of \"unelected bureaucrats\". He further commented that Family First cannot consider the social policy issues without considering social views, and drew attention to the TGA's response in the earlier Senate inquiry that the TGA \"cannot consider social and ethical issues\". Fielding drew attention to the guillotine being placed on the debate of the bill and the attitudes of the non-Government senators earlier criticising the Government on the industrial relations legislation being \"rammed through\" late last year.\nOther senators, including Guy Barnett (Lib.), Helen Polley (Labor), also later spoke against the bill; Senators Judith Adams (Lib.), Ruth Webber (Labor) spoke in support.\n\nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

Kelly has proposed an amendment with points stating that \"the Minister for Health and Ageing continuing to have the decision making role in relation to the approval of restricted goods...\", \"the Minister being required to obtain written advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration prior to giving written approval or refusal to approve\", \"the Minister's decision being subject to disallowance\".\nIn the debate on February 14, Andrew Laming (Liberal, Bowman) noted his intent to propose an amendment in the later consideration in detail stage, noting his views that the TGA process is \"so far removed...from the concerns and the beliefs of the community\" and that he is \"unable to convince [himself] that completely leaving these decisions to the TGA is the right thing to do\". His amendment loosely aims to propose a \"disallowable instrument in Parliament where there is a disagreement with the findings of the TGA.\"\nThe introduction of amendments has caused confusion on procedural matters February 15 in the Questions to the Speaker period (that follows Question Time), where members can ask questions of the Speaker on procedural and other technical matters. In the following vote on the proposed legislation, if one of the votes on the amendments succeeds, this has the effect of discontinuing the other amendment proposals, as each of the amendments proposed has the effect of being a complete alternative bill.\nThe RU486 debate will have precedence over all other matters in the House until it is dealt with.

A controversial conscience vote on the issue to overturn laws which prohibit Australian women's access to the drug, will be held in Federal parliament on February 9.\nThe Senate committee is considering a bill to remove ministerial control of the abortifacient drug Mifepristone - or RU486. Health Minister Tony Abbott says the issue of whether to allow women access to the drug  \"is one of principle.\" Abbott, who is against abortion, insists he is the right person to control the drug's use in Australia.\nBesides its use internationally as an \"abortion pill\", there may also be a small chance that it may help treat various other medical disorders including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and inoperable brain tumours amongst other conditions. Mifepristone is effectively banned in Australia, with Minister Abbott controlling whether it is made available. \nThe bill, sponsored by a group of female senators and MPs, would hand Mr Abbott's powers over to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) - the body that controls all other pharmaceutical drugs in Australia. The bill seeks to have the TGA determine the drug's availability and not the Health Minister.\nDemocrats Leader Lyn Allison, said she was \"cautiously confident\" the parliament will overturn the current arrangements when the conscience vote takes place. \"Those who are in favour of the bill are saying this is a choice that ought to be available to women and that on the basis of the studies that have been done overseas it is at least as safe as surgical termination,\" Senator Allison said.\nReproductive Choice Australia (RCA)say that medicine is placed at the whim of politics, saying that over 80% of Australians are pro-choice. A national survey found 87% of women aged 18 to 49 support a woman\u2019s right to choose.\nRU486 is available in much of western Europe and North America, but was effectively banned in Australia under laws initiated by now-retired pro-life senator Brian Harradine.\nChristine Read, medical director of family planning group FPA Health, said Misoprostol, also known as Cytotec, is across the world to invoke contractions to expel the fetus after a woman had taken RU486. \"It is used extensively in obstetrics and gynaecology for termination of pregnancy and to induce labour, so it's used in the medical management of miscarriage,\" Dr Read said.\nDr Sharman Stone, said yesterday the issue was not about Misoprostol, but rather that \"the TGA should make the decision about any drugs - that is its job. Any other conversations about other drugs are simply irrelevant to this argument,\" Dr Stone said.\nFamily First senator Steve Fielding says lifting a ban on RU486 would pave the way for do-it-yourself home abortions. \"RU486 is different to other drugs in that it is an abortion drug which could see do-it-yourself home abortions,\" he said in a statement. \"The question is, should policy be made by bureaucrats or our elected leaders?\nSenator Fielding claims Australians are worried about the high number of abortions in Australia, as reflected in submissions received by the Senate committee.\nOn Monday the committee will move to Sydney for a final day of hearings. \nShare this:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page is archived, and is no longer publicly editable.\nGot a correction?

He won on the second ballot, defeating Thompson Township tax accessor James Hedges of Pennsylvania, who initially ran unopposed. Party Chairman Toby Davis of Mississippi received the vice presidential nomination.\nThe Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the United States, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late 19th century. As its name suggests, the party heavily supported the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the US period known as Prohibition (1919\u201333). The party has declined since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, but has continued to nominate candidates for the presidential election.\nFellure, 79, has run for president in every election since 1988, though usually as a Republican. This run marks his first as a member of the Prohibition Party. On his campaign website, he cites the Authorized 1611 King James Bible as his presidential platform, and calls for the teaching of the Bible in public schools, criminalization of homosexuality, and the elimination of abortion, the liquor industry and pornography. On economics, he supports reducing taxes and balancing the federal budget.\n\u2014Vice Chairman June GriffinHedges, the first Prohibition Party member elected to public office since 1959, announced his campaign in February 2010, and was the only candidate until last month. According to Vice Chairman June Griffin: \"While Jim has contributed valuable resources to this Party...his positions regarding Environmentalism and passivity toward war forced me to vote for Jack Fellure. As well, his insistence on a moratorium on the building of nuclear plants caused much unrest among the membership. Yet he prevailed to install this plank.\" \nThe ten voting Prohibition Party convention delegates and a few guests met for the National Convention, which began on Monday at the Holiday Inn Express in Cullman. Tuesday featured a short greeting from Cullman Mayor Max Townson, followed by addresses from Libertarian consultant Stephen P. Gordon, Ballot Access News publisher Richard Winger, and Eunie Smith of the Eagle Forum.\nGordon, who previously worked as the e-Campaign manager for the 2008 Bob Barr presidential campaign, jokingly commented that his speech \"stunk\". He opened his address with the joke that \"the way to pick out the libertarian at a Prohibition Party function is that I\u2019m the one wearing the Jerry Garcia tie.\" He discussed how third party candidates could utilize new media to their advantage, but avoided any ideological topics.\nWinger, an expert on election law, discussed ballot access and the history of the Prohibition Party. He notably explained how the party had cost the Republicans presidential victories in the elections of 1884 and 1916, which forestalled the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment by Republicans, who wanted to do away with the alcohol issue. Gordon later commented that Winger's speech was well-received by the audience.\nAfter Winger's speech, the convention broke for lunch. Afterwards, Smith, the widow of former Congressman Albert L. Smith, Jr., focused on immigration and education in her address. When asked about the Eagle Forum's participation in the fight against alcohol, she commented that the group was focused on more pressing issues such as gambling.\nAfter the nomination, some party members traveled to the grave of Sidney Catts in Florida. Catts, who died in 1936, was the first and only state governor elected from the Prohibition Party. \nThe party will now begin ballot access drives in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, New Jersey, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee and Arkansas. In 2008, the late Gene Amondson appeared on the ballot in Colorado, Florida and Louisiana and picked up a total of 653 votes. \n\nHave an opinion on this story?

First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that\u2019s really rare. If it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.

I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.\"\nAkin's comments soon gained national notoriety, with numerous politicians condemning his comments. Senators Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have both called for him to drop out of the race.  Presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Akin's comments were  \"inexcusable\".  President Barack Obama said in a press conference on Monday, \"...We shouldn't have a bunch of politicians, a majority of whom are men, making health care decisions on behalf of women.\"\nThe National Republican Senatorial committee has said it will no longer fund Akin's campaign, regardless if he drops out or not.

Bury to grant an injunction against a new Arizona abortion law. On Wednesday Planned Parenthood and Arizona attorney Mike Tryon were in court to present their arguments.\nThe law passed in 2012 would take effect on April 1. According to Planned Parenthood, if the law takes effect, it will prevent some women from having an abortion. The Arizona state Attorney General's Office states it is only regulating one form of abortion.\nAbortions are usually medical abortions, meaning medication is taken to induce abortion. The new law would only allow use of abortion medication just as approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or specified by the product label. It would also require they administer the medication before seven weeks into the pregnancy. Previous cut off time was set at nine weeks. It would also require the medication be administered at the abortion facility. Planned Parenthood says requiring administration at the facility is a problem particularly for those outside of cities, as the medication is administered over several days.\nMedical abortions commonly combine two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol. These two drugs are taken together. Doctors don't usually give them at the \"on-label\" dosage. For abortions misoprostol is given at a higher amount than the label says. Planned Parenthood says when it is given at the lower level the abortions may be unsuccessful and require surgery, putting the woman at additional risk. The other drug mifepristone has the opposite problem. The FDA has not updated their approval since 2000. The FDA approval is for a larger dose. Most doctors use the two together. They have found that when the two are combined they are just as effective as mifepristone alone, at the higher dose.  Planned Parenthood says the combination of the two is the safest way to have an abortion. \nThe state says this law is part of their responsibility to protect public health.\nThe Judge is expected to rule before April 1, when the law would take effect.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero wants to introduce abortion on demand, allowing women as young as 16 to have abortions without their parents' consent. Currently women may only terminate pregnancies in the predominantly Catholic country under specific circumstances.\n\u2014Jose Carlos Felicidad, 67, retired naval technicianThe 1.5-kilometer (one-mile) march contained members from 42 religious and civil society groups, with 600 buses and several planes used to bring anti-abortion supporters, according to organisers. The protest was also supported by the conservative opposition People's Party and the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe march started under a banner emblazoned with \"Every Life Matters\", and tens of thousands of supporters carried banners and flags with \"For Life, Women and Motherhood\" and \"Women Against Abortion\" and \"Madrid 2009, Capital of Life\", along the route to the Plaza de Independencia, where many more waited.\nA spokesman for one of the rally organiser, HazteOir (Make Yourself Heard), reported that approximately 1.5 million people had participated in the rally and march. The Madrid regional government put the figures at around 1.2 million.\nThe supporters want the government to withdraw the draft law currently up for debate in the parliament in November, which would introduce abortion on demand within the first 14 weeks of a pregnancy, based on laws currently in place in most other European Union countries. It would replace Spain's law introduced in 1985, which allows abortion in cases of rape, when there are signs of foetal abnormality, or when a woman's physical or psychological health is at risk. This latter category has been used to justify 112,000 abortions in 2007, a majority of which occurred in Spain.\n\"This new law is a barbarity. In this country, they protect animals more than human beings,\" said Jose Carlos Felicidad, aged 67, a retired naval technician, who had come to the rally in Madrid  from the town of Algeciras.\nPrime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero spoke in defence of the draft law, saying the state should not \"intervene in the free and private decision of a woman, who is the one who has to take on the responsibility of a pregnancy during her entire life.\" According to the government, the law is about respect and women's rights, and that alternatives will be explained first to anyone wishing to terminate a pregnancy. It also said that the new law will make abortion less dangerous, by making sure that the procedure is not done after 22 weeks.\nThe prime minister has passed a series of social reforms since he came to power in 2004. Among them were measures to legalise gay marriage, give more rights to transsexuals, and permit fast-track divorces.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Until the new legislation, NSW had the most restrictive anti-abortion law in Australia.  The NSW legislature in Sydney abolished any existing common law rules about abortion and legalized terminations up to week 22 of a pregnancy.\nSince 1900, under the state's criminal code, abortions were only allowed if a doctor determined the mother was in danger, either mentally or physically. The bill was drafted by Alex Greenwich who said on the parliament floor, \"It follows decades of work from women's rights campaigners, activists and people in the Parliament\". The upper house debate involved 102 amendments, and was amongst the longest they have ever debated a bill.\nMember of parliament (MP) Kevin Conolly said a law allowing the termination of a life marked a \"sad day for NSW\". Former prime minister Tony Abbott said, \"It is a license for sex-selection abortions. It is a license for late-term abortion [...] It is effectively infanticide on demand.\" \nMP Penny Sharpe, who co-sponsored the bill, said, \"The current law has meant women and doctors have a threat of 10 years in jail for making this decision and that's not okay\". Early opponent MP Tanya Davies said, \"We have moved the bill to a better place\".\nPremier Gladys Berejiklian was not present at the bill's final vote.\nNew South Wales is the most populated Australian state. The state of South Australia still limits abortions to cases with two doctors' approval.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The Judge said that the Planned Parenthood groups shared \"office space, expenses, employee wages, equipment and supplies\" with doctors who performed abortions and therefore was ineligible for the grant money.\nThis is the third time the case has come before a circuit judge \u2014 twice previously circuit court judges ruled that Planned Parenthood was not eligible for grant funding from Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. \nThe Missouri Supreme Court overturned two previous rulings without addressing the merits of the case itself.

{"title": "Congressional computers continue to be used to vandalize Wikipedia - Wikinews, the free news source", "date": "Wednesday, May 6, 2009", "tags": ["Wikimedia Foundation", "Original reporting", "North America", "Politics and conflicts", "US Congress", "US Senate", "US House of Representatives", "Barack Obama", "John McCain", "Jack Abramoff", "Abortion", "Republican Party (United States)", "Harlem, New York", "New York Times", "Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia", "Manhattan", "United States", "Published", "Archived", "Pages with template loops", "Pages with pull-quotes", "Pages with defaulting non-local links", "Pages with categorizable local links", "Articles not disputed"], "text": "\u00a0\nWikinews contributors have discovered that members of the United States Congress or members of their staff have recently been making questionable edits to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia anyone can edit. This continues the trend identified by four exclusive Wikinews reports over a four-year period exposing questionable and fraudulent edits made beginning in 2005 by Congress members or staff.\nBeginning in 2006, Wikinews reported that members of Congress or their staff were vandalizing Wikipedia by removing critical information in various articles, or adding false or offensive information. These edits were and continue to be done using computers owned or operated by the United States government.\n\u2014Congressional IP address 143.231.249.138, January 14, 2009In this new investigation, Wikinews has found that at least two of the three major Internet Protocol Addresses (IP) attached to computers used by members of the U.S. House of Representatives and their staff have been the source of Wikipedia edits for several years. As recently as April 2009 they have been adding or removing false and/or offensive information from articles related to political figures or members of Congress.\nAlthough the IP addresses belong exclusively to the U.S Congress as a whole, they are linked to many different computers throughout the U.S. which are used by many different House representatives or their staff members. In response to an edit, another Wikipedia contributor posts a message on the user discussion page for the IP address, advising anyone that may view the page that the address belongs to Congress.\nIn January, one individual using a Congressional computer removed a source in an article. Five minutes later, using the same congressional IP address, someone replaced the source with an apology saying, \"sorry--House of Reps IPs should not be editing [Wikipedia], even other office's pages on lunch break.\" Despite the advisories, Wikinews has found that the individuals continued to make vandal-like edits to the encyclopedia.\nIn one instance, Wikinews found that someone with one of the IP addresses, 143.231.249.141, began to edit the Wikipedia article for Steve Austria, the Republican representative for Ohio's 7th congressional district. The individual began to edit on March 18, 2009 at 23:32 UTC. He or she used the official House of Representatives gateway to remove a section of information relating to inaccurate comments Austria made about The Great Depression. Austria stated in an interview with The Columbus Dispatch in February that Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in 1933 caused the U.S. to go into a depression.\n\"When Roosevelt did this, he put our country into a Great Depression. ... He tried to borrow and spend, he tried to use the Keynesian approach, and our country ended up in a Great Depression. That's just history,\" said Austria during the February 11 interview. He later admitted that his statement was wrong, saying Roosevelt's spending \"did not have the desired effect,\" which caused the depression. Exactly two minutes later on March 18, the same IP address removed information relating to bloggers accusing Austria of plagiarism in 2008. They accused him of taking credit for a column that was published in his name in the Xenia Gazette on September 2, 2008. Bloggers had discovered that the column was a direct copy of a report on the history of Labor Day originally published by the U.S. Department of Labor. The edits were reverted, the last being over four hours after the information was removed. Despite some constructive edits, such as correcting the spelling of Wisconsin congressman Steve Kagen's name and correcting grammatical errors, the same IP removed the information in both sections a total of six times from March 18 to April 24, 2009.\nAfter seeing the suspicious edits, Wikinews examined the edit history for Austria's article to see if any other suspicious edits were made. After a brief search, Wikinews discovered that the IP address 65.189.244.162 removed the same information just 15 days earlier on March 3, being the first address to remove the information. Only one edit has been made to Wikipedia from that IP address so far. After tracing the address, Wikinews discovered the person who made the edits lives in or near Fairborn, which is located 8.5 miles from Beavercreek, where Austria currently resides. Austria also grew up in Xenia which is located just 12 miles from Fairborn and only 8 miles from Beavercreek. \nAnother individual, with the IP address 75.187.63.132, also removed the allegations of plagiarism from Austria's article in February. The individual removed what they called \"Politically Motivated BS [bullshit]\" from the article of Deborah Pryce, former congresswoman for Ohio's 15th congressional district. The information was related to fundraisers between 2001 and 2004 that were held at restaurants belonging to convicted felon and former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. After tracing the IP address, Wikinews found that the edit was made from a computer located in Columbus, Ohio, the location of Pryce's offices and one of the cities in Pryce's district. Wikinews contacted Austria by e-mail for a statement, but so far there has been no response.\nFollowing those discoveries, Wikinews investigated another IP address used by the U.S. House of Representatives. On April 30, 2009, the address 143.231.249.138 made an edit that listed Devin Nunes, the representative for California's 21st congressional district, as being a member of the Nazi Party. The address also made less questionable edits, but after investigating further, it was discovered that the IP address removed critical information on April 29 from the article of Gregory Meeks, the representative for New York's 6th congressional district. The information removed was related to a column by the the New York Times which stated that Meeks initially supported former 2008 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama in the race for the White House. According to the Times, Meeks changed his support to Obama because he was part of \"a young black political class [which was] seeking to assert the neighborhood\u2019s power against what it sees as an older establishment, based in Harlem, that has long exercised disproportionate influence in New York City.\" \nThe address 143.231.249.138 was also responsible for adding highly biased statements to articles related to abortion. On March 16, 2009 it altered the Wikipedia article Crisis pregnancy center, adding that the centers were \"abortion mills, which exist only to kill people, also present themselves as medical facilities.\" On March 20, the IP changed the Project Rachel article to include, \"millions of women have deep regrets and, often, suffer psychological problems after undergoing an abortion--a fact the abortion industry and mass media will not admit.\" 143.231.249.141 also added racial slurs and references to gay pedophilia into William A. Donohue's article in February, saying he has \"participated in the controversial act of 'tabeling', in which he takes a small child, places him upon a table, and 'puts the lord inside him.'\"\nIn an attempt to find out where the edits were being made and by whom, Wikinews contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation to receive advice on how to file an information request with the U.S. government under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The request would have been made to release the names of the individuals and offices responsible for the edits. However, according to Marcia Hofmann, a staff attorney for the EFF, who specializes in FOIA related matters, the U.S. government is not required to provide the information.\n\"None of the U.S. open government laws extends to records in the possession of members of Congress or their employees. Put differently, it's not so much a question of what the information is (identities of congressional staff) as where the information is (in congressional offices, which aren't covered by open government laws),\" said Hoffmann in an exclusive interview with Wikinews. She also added that \"FOIA [requests] cover records in executive branch agencies and departments\" only.\nSuspicious and/or fraudulent edits to Wikipedia made by Congress and other government entities were first reported by Wikinews in February 2006, after the U.S. government engaged in Wikipedia vandalism and other forms of perceived biased editing of articles. The House of Representatives IP addresses were briefly banned from editing Wikipedia articles in the wake of the initial controversy. A few days later, Wikinews reported that staff members of the offices of United States Senators, using Senate-linked IP addresses, also edited Wikipedia, in some cases, removing facts and sourced material from articles. In 2008, Wikinews also reported that staff members for then 2008 candidates for U.S. president Barack Obama and John McCain made questionable edits to Wikipedia. \n\nHave an opinion on this story?

San Antonio Archbishop Jose Gomez criticized the school for not consulting with him before offering the invitation. He stated that the candidate's pro-choice position on abortion contradicts the religion's rejection of the practice and added that her \"positions against the teachings of the church and life issues\" should deem her ineligible for a campaign visit. The University is privately owned and separate from the Catholic Church on decision-making authority. It stated in an official press release that the University does not endorse candidates and that it understood the ideological differences between Senator Clinton and the Catholic Church. Despite this, Archbishop Gomez believed the event involved him since it occurred in his archdiocese, and wondered why Senator Clinton decided to hold a rally at a Catholic University. \nClinton's main strength in past primaries and caucuses have been among Latino voters who have propelled her to victories in California, Nevada and Florida. Most Latinos are Roman Catholic, which might explain Clinton's visit to the University in conjunction with the upcoming March 4 Texas Primary.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

About 20 youths, some of whom were carrying signs reading \"Leave my Pope alone\" approached the protesters. One person was injured.\nOn Tuesday, after arriving in Africa, the Pope stated that \"you can't resolve it [AIDS] with the distribution of condoms. On the contrary, it increases the problem.\" He suggested that sexual behavior was the issue that should be focused on and that the solution must be found in \"spiritual and human awakening\" and \"friendship for those who suffer\".\nThe comments were criticized by French politicians from all parties. Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner called the Pope's comments \"the opposite of tolerance and understanding\" and Human Rights Minister Rama Yade said she was \"dumbfounded\" by them. According to UNAIDS about 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV, about two-thirds of all people living with HIV. AIDS-awareness activists Act Up-Paris said in a statement that \"by refusing to allow the promotion of condoms, the Catholic Church has millions of deaths on its conscience\". Act Up-Paris also organized a \"die-in\" outside the Notre-Dame on Sunday and carried portraits of the Pope with the slogan \"Benoit XVI Assasin.\"\nFrance is traditionally a Catholic country, although many are non-practicing. On the Pope's last visit to France in 2008, around 200,000 people visited the open-air service in Paris. However, a recent CSA poll by Le Parisien showed that 57% of the 1,102 adult respondents have a negative opinion of the Pope, up from 25% in September 2008, just before his visit to France; 23% has a positive opinion, down from 53%; the remainder has no opinion. A separate IFOP poll by Journal du Dimanche showed that 43% of French Catholics want the pontiff to leave.\nIt was not the only incident during the Pope's journey through Africa that received a lot of criticism. Earlier this week, on the plane to Cameroon, the Pope judged sexual abuse of women, but at the same time stated that abortion in the case of incest or rape, which is legal in 45 African countries, should not be an option.\nToday, the Pope returns to The Vatican.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

If successful, the drug would then have to be approved by the Threrapeutic Goods Administration before it would be allowed to be used in Australia.\nSenator Fiona Nash of the Nationals argues that the bill is not about abortion but about process. She said \"What's been put forward here is who is best able to judge the quality, safety and efficacy of this particular drug and who is best able to judge whether it should be used in Australia\".\nMs Nash believes that the TGA should be responsible for allowing or denying the use of drugs in Australia, not the health minister.\nLyn Elisson, leader of the Democrats said that only around 2,000 of the submissions would be considered as the remainder do not meet the senate's terms of reference. She also said \"This bill is not about the morality or legality of abortion.\n\"It's really about whether the Minister for Health should have the power of veto over an alternative to legal surgical abortion.\"\nNational's senator Barnaby Joyce argues that all opinions should be taken into account and that the enquiry should be conducted for at least a week.\nPeter Slipper, MP for the Liberal party claims that the proposed legislation can not be separated from the RU486 issue. He told ABC radio \"I believe it would be a negation of our responsibility if we were to flick the decision to an unelected body, an unaccountable body, such as the TGA.\"\nIt is believed that only 100 submissions are from those supporting the use of RU486.\nThe inquiry has received international attention with submissions from the US, New Zealand and Austria.\nThis pill has been available for use in France since 1988, in Switzerland since 1999.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

The president had previously called it \"a matter of public health\".\n\"[W]ithin the next 10 days, I will present a bill for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy that legalises abortion at the initial time of pregnancy and allows women to access the health system when they make the decision to abort\", Fern\u00e1ndez said.  Thousands of people had gathered outside the National Congress with slogans supporting the legalisation of abortion of pregnancy.\nAbortion of pregnancy is currently illegal in the Catholic-majority country, and is permitted only in two cases: if the pregnancy was a product of rape, or if it poses a risk to the woman.  Fern\u00e1ndez said the law has \"condemned many women, generally of limited resources, to resort to abortive practices in absolute secrecy, putting their health and sometimes their lives at risk\".\nEstimates by the Argentinian government state about 350 thousand illegal abortions are carried out in the country each year.  Illegal abortion is a crime punishable with a prison term in the Latin American country since 1921.  Saying \"there are many abortions despite the criminal threat\" ((es))Spanish language: \u200dhay muchos abortos pese a la amenaza penal, President Fern\u00e1ndez elaborated, \"A state that is present must protect citizens in general and obviously women in particular.  And in the 21st Century, every society needs to respect the individual choice of its members to decide freely about their bodies ((es))Spanish language: \u200dEn el siglo XXI, toda sociedad necesita respetar la decisi\u00f3n individual de sus miembros para disponer libremente de sus cuerpos\".\nFollowing the president's announcements, the director of Argentina's Amnesty International, Mariela Belski, said the president had \"heard the demands of women, adolescents and girls\".\nThe proceedings of the abortion rights was criticised by archbishop Monsenor Jorge Eduardo Scheinig.  Calling it a \"culture of death\" the archbishop said \"We need to pray so that in Argentina, the yes to life is stronger than death.\"\nUruguay, Guyana and Cuba are the other Latin American countries where abortion during the early weeks of pregnancy is legal.  Back in 2018, the Argentine congress approved a bill legalising abortion, but it was dismissed by the senate.\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Unlike the half a million who walked to the White House waving signs last Saturday, these came to support one of the policies espoused by the United States president Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence: making abortion harder to come by.\nThis event, called the March for Life, has taken place every year since 1973, the year abortion was ruled legal in the U.S. by the Roe v Wade Supreme Court decision. \"Pro-life\" is the umbrella term of choice of the U.S. political movement that favors rendering abortion illegal and less accessible and \"pro-choice\" is the corresponding term for the movement that favors keeping it legal and accessible.\nDonald Trump has recently reversed Barack Obama's repeal of a global funding ban, which prohibits the use of U.S. funds for any organization that provides or counsels for abortions abroad.\nTrump specifically asked Vice President Mike Pence to attend the march. \"Life is winning in America!\" he told the crowd, noting that he serves under \"a president who I proudly say stands for the right to life.\" A Pew Research Institute poll taken this year shows that 69% of Americans support the Roe v Wade decision, up from 60% in 1992.\nOne reason why many opponents of abortion say the procedure should be illegal is the belief, often religious, that life begins at conception. Correspondingly, the event was accompanied by religious music and speeches, including one by Catholic Archbishop Timothy Dolan. One reporter for the BBC noted a large number of young women in the crowd, especially college students. Signs included \"Women DO Regret Abortion\" and \"I am the Pro-Life Generation,\" many held up by young women. Others showed pictures of fetuses, quoted Bible verses, or called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood by name. There is already a law in place, the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortions, though this money can go to organizations that also perform abortions so long as the funds are kept separate.\nAs governor of Indiana, Mike Pence established some of the country's strictest abortion laws. Years ago, Donald Trump said publicly that he was \"very pro-choice\" but has since changed his stance. Trump commented, as is his custom, via Tweet, \"To all of you marching \u2014 you have my full support!\"\nThe crowds in Washington, D.C. yesterday numbered in the tens of thousands, in contrast to the roughly 500,000 in last week's Women's March, though some organizations did attend both events. March for Life President Jeanne Mancini told National Public Radio, \"I think we're a pretty different march \u2014 we're a one-issue march.\"\nThe abortion rate in the United States hit a record low in 2013, but the pro- and anti-abortion rights movements are at odds about why. Both sides credit increased availability of contraceptives, but anti-abortion organizations tend to give more credit to state-level laws that have made it harder to keep abortion clinics open and limit abortions to only the early stages of pregnancy. As NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue pointed out, the anti-abortion movement now has the opportunity to work at the federal level; \"We're living at the apex of a 40-year, state-by-state effort by the anti-choice people [...] We have to be prepared for the fact that they've got all the pieces in place to do real damage.\"\n\nHave an opinion on this story?

Nathanson died in New York; the cause of death was announced as cancer. During his time as an obstetrician he estimated that he was involved in nearly 75,000 abortions, about 5,000 of which he performed himself. He performed his last abortion in 1979; shortly thereafter he became an anti-abortion activist.\nNathanson opened an abortion clinic in New York City in the 1960s but had performed abortions beforehand. In the 1940s he completed an abortion on his then girlfriend who was pregnant with his child. In 1969, he became one of the founders of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, an organization that still exists today.\nAfter performing his last abortion and becoming an anti-abortion advocate, Nathanson narrated The Silent Scream, a film that showed a three month-old fetus being aborted. As well as films he also wrote books about abortion including his 1996 autobiography The Hand of God.\nHis wife, Christine Reisner-Nathanson spoke about his change of views. She said, \"When he was an abortion doctor he was seen as a pariah by the medical community and when he went pro-life he was scorned by the women in the pro-abortion movement.\"\n\nWhat do you think of Bernard Nathanson's life?

Those people include gays, Nazis, women seeking abortion, gun owners, SPAM mailers and drug users.  People who are often not popular with various segments of the public.  The ACLU's philosophy is not that it agrees or disagrees with any of these people and the choices that they make, but that they have personal liberties that must not be trampled upon.  \nIn Wikinews reporter David Shankbone's interview with the President of the ACLU, Nadine Strossen, he wanted to cover some basic ground on the ACLU's beliefs.  Perhaps the area where they are most misunderstood or have their beliefs most misrepresented is their feelings about religion in the public sphere.  The ACLU categorically does not want to see religion disappear from schools or in the public forum; but they do not want to see government advocacy of any particular religion.  Thus, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's placement of a ten ton monument to the Ten Commandments outside the courthouse is strenuously opposed; but \"Lone Ranger of the Manger\" Rita Warren's placement of nativity scenes in public parks is vigorously defended.  In the interview, Strossen talks about how certain politicians and televangelists purposefully misstate the law and the ACLU's work in order to raise funds for their campaigns.\nDavid Shankbone's discussion with Strossen touches upon many of the ACLU's hot button issues:  religion, Second Amendment rights, drug liberalization, \"partial-birth abortion\" and whether or not George W. Bush should be impeached.  It may surprise the reader that many ideas people have about the most visible of America's civil libertarian organizations are not factually correct and that the ACLU often works closely with many of the organizations people think despise its existence.\nDavid Shankbone:  Why did you want to be an attorney?\nDS:  Why?\nDS:  What family experiences?\nDS:  What were you taught about him?\nDS:  When you went to Harvard, were you an activist on campus?\nDS:  What would you say the atmosphere was like on campus back then, with all the issues that were being contended with, how would you describe it?\nDS:  You had mentioned that one of the things that affected you with your family was seeing points of view not being allowed to be expressed.  Many religious conservatives would say that the ACLU opposes having their points of view in the schools.  How would you respond?\nDS:  So there isn\u2019t any opposition to having religious groups meeting inside of public schools?\nDS:  Would you defend someone\u2019s right to have a religious meeting in a public school?\nDS:  The ACLU has been involved in removing religious symbology from the public forum.  Can you state your views on that?\nDS:  Can you give an example of a religious symbology case where the ACLU supported religious freedom?\nDS:  Do people misconstrue or misunderstand your work and what you have argued for or against?\nDS:  \u2014and the ACLU said\u2014\nDS:  \u2014Roy Moore?\nDS:  When does a symbol become historical and when is it intrinsically religious?  For instance, a community that was once a mission and they have had a large cross on a mountaintop that to them is more historical marker.\nDS:  Well, two years.\nDS:  Almost a slave.\nDS:  Yes, 3/5ths!  [Laughs]\nDS:  That\u2019s always the problem in law:  who is that reasonable observer?  Someone from the community, someone who has just moved into the community?\nDS:  Going back to when you have debated religious conservatives and they make the charge that what the ACLU is working toward is no religion in schools, and you can\u2019t have a prayer group, do you think there is a conscious motivation to misrepresent what you have done and want, or is it a misunderstanding?\nDS:  Don\u2019t you think the way both sides go about engaging each other harms America?  Take the partial-birth abortion Supreme Court case.  Did you read Justice Stevens' New York Times interview with Jeff Rosen?\nDS:  He said it was a silly decision that wasn\u2019t particularly important\u2014\nDS:  Yes.  He said it was, in the end, not a particularly important case.\nDS:  He was talking about in terms of the effect, that it didn\u2019t have much of an effect because there were other legal alternatives to that particular method of abortion.\nDS:  The question I have is that on its face it was deciding one particular issue in the abortion debate, but a lot of pro-choice organizations paint this as, \u201cWe are now getting ready to ban abortion; this is the first step on what might be a short road\u2014\u201c\nDS:  Yes, a slippery slope.  Isn\u2019t it almost the same thing when the evangelicals say, \u201cThey are coming for your prayer, your kids aren\u2019t going to be able to pray or allow God in schools.\u201d\nDS:  Is it healthy for us to be ringing these alarm bells every time one nuance in the argument gets addressed?\nDS:  But let\u2019s say the Christians give you that, and they say, \u201cThis is just the first step and what they ultimately want is not to have the word God said anywhere in the public square.\u201d\nDS:  Whereas in the abortion argument it is a stated goal to bring about the end of Roe v. Wade.\nDS:  When you hear the phrase \u201cjudicial activism\u201d what comes to your mind?\nDS:  So you believe in the living Constitution?\nDS:  \u201cThese are cruel and unusual punishments\u201d\nDS:  Do you think there is a right to privacy in the Constitution?\nDS:  What argument for capital punishment do you think is most compelling for it?\nDS:  The criminal justice system is a rehabilitative system?\nDS:  Is that what it should be?\nDS:  How does it do that?\nDS:  Are you an active member of NORML?\nDS:  Do you believe in the decriminalization of marijuana?  \nDS:  Can you give me your case for that?\nDS:  Should suicide be legal?\nDS:  So how would you like to die?\nDS:  You wouldn\u2019t want a Terri Schiavo situation?\nDS:  So you have the choice, what is your choice?\nDS:  What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity right now?\nDS:  However you interpret the question.\nDS:  How has the Iraq War affected your world view?\nDS:  Have you seen a precipitous drop?\nDS:  Ahmadinejad came to Columbia and brought that argument up.\nDS:  It\u2019s surprising that Hagel gave that criticism since it is his party that has instituted the fear of government into our culture.  Such as Reagan\u2019s famous line that the most terrifying words in the English language are, \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\nDS:  When I interviewed Gay Talese, I asked him how the Iraq War affected him and he said it had not.  He said, \u201cI wish it did!\u201d  He said he doesn\u2019t feel anything and that he doesn\u2019t think anyone else does, either.  He feels you can\u2019t have a war affect people unless you have conscription.\nDS:  But they see it as voluntary service.  It\u2019s a voluntary army.\nDS:  --That\u2019s what Talese said.  Senator Brownback told me he is against conscription, and it\u2019s interesting that the people who are most for the war are the people who are most for a voluntary army.  \nDS:  Rangel\u2019s bent is that if people were actually fighting in the wars, or forced to fight, that it would bring public opinion against the war.\nDS:  Do you think George Bush should be impeached?\nDS:  You just don\u2019t think it would be productive.\nDS:  Where do you stand on the Second Amendment and the rights of gun owners?  Are the rights accorded to well-armed militias, or is it accorded to unfettered rights of individuals to own guns?\nDS:  Last question:  what trait do you deplore in people?\nDS:  That\u2019s about the best answer I can think of coming from the President of the ACLU! [Laughs]\nDS:  That you deplore in people.\nDS:  Do you deplore any in yourself?\n\nHave an opinion on this story?
